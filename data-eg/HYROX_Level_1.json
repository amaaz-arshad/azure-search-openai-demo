Our bodies are incredible feats of engineering, capable of executing a wide range of movements with precision and efficiency. This capability largely stems from the complex interaction between our muscles, bones, and nervous system, a relationship that forms the backbone of functional anatomy. Understanding this interaction is vital for every Hiro coach. With a solid grasp of functional anatomy, you'll understand why certain movements and exercises are more effective than others. You also discover how to optimize your training to engage multiple muscle groups and other crucial body structures like the elastic recall system and complex movements, helping you and your athletes achieve their athletic goals. So let's dive right in. Chapter: Functional Anatomy and Biomechanicsin context of HYROX – the sport of Fitness Racing Functional anatomy and kinetics play a crucial role not only in traditional athletic training and competition, but also in emerging fitness disciplines like functional fitness or hybrid training and sports such as HYROX - the World Series of Fitness Racing. Functional fitness training, characterized by exercises mimicking real-life movements, heavily relies on an understanding of Functional Anatomy and Biomechanics. Coaches design workouts targeting multiple muscle groups simultaneously by understanding the body's movement in various planes and under different loads. This improves overall functional strength and mobility. Special exercises are chosen for functional fitness routines because they engage multiple joints and muscle groups, reflecting functional anatomy's principles. Within HYROX, the Sport of Fitness Racing, which combines functional fitness exercises with running, Functional Anatomy and Biomechanics are key for both training and performance optimization. Competitors must navigate functional fitness challenges, such as Sled Push and Pull, Burpee Broad Jump or Sandbag Lunges as well as RowErg, SkiErg, WallBalls or Farmers Carries, interspersed with running segments. Understanding these movements' biomechanics is vital for efficient execution and energy conservation. In HYROX racing, knowledge of Biomechanics is particularly relevant, as athletes constantly adapt to shifting external forces during dynamic movements. For instance, during a Sled Push, athletes must generate sufficient force to propel the sled forward while maintaining stability and balance. Understanding efficient force application and momentum usage can make the difference between a competitive time and fatigue-induced slowdowns. In both functional fitness training and HYROX racing, a thorough understanding of Functional Anatomy and Biomechanics allows coaches to tailor training programs to enhance performance and reduce injury risk. Trainers can prescribe corrective exercises and drills to address specific needs by identifying movement patterns, imbalances, and areas of weakness, ultimately optimizing athletic potential. In conclusion, Functional Anatomy and Biomechanics are integral to both traditional athletic endeavors and modern fitness disciplines like functional fitness training and sports such as HYROX racing. By embracing these principles, coaches can enhance the performance of their athletes, reduce injury risk, and achieve greater success."

Bone strength is the result of a combination of the hardness of these minerals combined with the tensile properties of collagen (derived from protein). Too little of one (e.g. collagen) and the bone will shatter like an egg shell; too little of the other (e.g. mineral salts) and bone will bend like a piece of rubber. 25% water, 25% protein, 50% mineral salts Chapter: Ossification - The Process of Bone Formation Although bone is rigid, it behaves like any other living tissue; it is constantly being broken down, rebuilt and adapting to the stresses placed on it. The process of bone formation is called ossification which begins in the womb and continues throughout adult life. The hardening and growth process involves replacing a cartilage ‘framework’ with mineral salts. Bones of young children are softer than those of adults because they still contain significant proportions of cartilage. The hardening process may not be complete until 30 years of age. So, in early life, the emphasis of ossification is very much on bone growth and bone hardening, whereas the process in adulthood is more geared towards replacing and maintaining existing bone material. Whilst there is quite a diversity of cells involved in the bone formation process, the primary cells involved in bone growth are osteoblasts, which function to replace worn out or damaged bone tissue. Their activity is coordinated with that of the osteoclast cells, which remove the old bony tissue. Maintenance of a healthy skeletal system is dependent upon a balance of osteoblast and osteoclast activity. This can vary according to the region of bone concerned; the end of the femur, for example, can be completely remodeled every few months, which contrasts with the bone shafts which may never be fully remodeled. It is also worth noting that remodeling will tend to follow the lines of stress placed upon the bone. Exercise and habitual posture therefore, have a fundamental influence over the health of the skeletal system. Incorrect exercise technique coupled with a generally poor alignment, will lead to a remodeling process that may reinforce the predominating bad posture. Chapter: Hormonal Regulation Of Bone In the pre-puberty years, bone formation is predominantly regulated by human growth hormone (HGH) produced by the pituitary gland located in the brain. At puberty however, testosterone produced by the male testes and estrogen produced by the female ovaries begin to exert a greater influence. In women, estrogen promotes growth of the skeleton and development of the unique female skeletal characteristics (i.e. the broader pelvis). Testosterone on the other hand, causes males to have larger, denser and more robust skeletons. Chapter: The Skeletal System And Calcium Regulation Although calcium provides the skeletal system with rigidity it is also involved in several other important functions. These include muscular contraction, transmission of nervous impulses and regulating fluid balance. Too much or too little calcium in the body can easily upset these processes, thus bones act as calcium reservoirs which can either take up or release calcium depending on the body’s needs. When calcium is scarce, it will be withdrawn from the bones, which is why diets that are chronically low in calcium tend to increase the risk of osteoporosis – a bone-related medical condition characterized by brittle, porous bones. Chapter: Osteoporosis (Brittle Bone Disease) Bone remodeling is a delicate balance of osteoblast and osteoclast activity. Osteoporosis is caused by an imbalance in this process whereby osteoblast activity decreases causing a reduction in bone growth. This leads to a gradual loss in bone density and ultimately gives rise to a skeletal system that is unable to withstand the forces placed upon it. There are several potential causes of osteoporosis however one of the biggest is the drop in estrogen levels associated with the menopause. This makes women significantly more likely to develop the condition than men. In men, a proportion of circulating testosterone (which is produced throughout life) is converted into estrogen and this is thought to provide men with significant protection against loss of bone mass. Additionally, men have bigger, denser bones in the first place, so some bone loss is not as noticeable or as damaging. Low calorific intake and/or overtraining also increase the risk of osteoporosis in females by depleting body fat stores which are one of the primary sources of estrogen. Poor quality diets which are lacking in or have an imbalance of minerals and vitamins also increase the risks by limiting the availability of calcium. The table below provides a summary of some of the risk factors associated with osteoporosis. Osteoporosis risk factors: female sex – due to drop in estrogen levels (particularly at the menopause) calcium deficiency – through poor diet or poor absorption lack of weight-bearing exercise smoking – causes a drop in estrogen levels family history certain drugs, such as alcohol which interrupt normal hormonal and calcium regulation low body fat overtraining Chapter: The Classification And Structure Of Bone Bone tissue varies in arrangement and depending on its location and functions, comes in two main forms; compact and cancellous. Compact bone has a relatively high density of bone matter. It forms the external surfaces of bones, predominates in the shafts of long bones and serves to resist compressive forces. It is very strong and quite heavy. Cancellous bone, in comparison, is relatively more porous and if viewed closely has a spongy appearance. It predominates in the interior of bones and especially at bone ends (epiphyses). The spaces within the cancellous bone form a vital function by housing red marrow, which is responsible for red blood cell production. Cancellous bone, because of its honey-combe structure is strong but is also light. Bones can be classified according to their shape and will generally fall into one of five shape categories; long, short, flat, irregular and sesamoid: 1. Long bones – have a greater length than width and consist of a shaft with normally two extremities. They contain mostly cancellous bone in their distal ends and more compact bone in their middles. They principally act as levers and include the humerus, femur, fibula, tibia, ulna, radius, metacarpals, metatarsals and phalanges. 2. Short bones – have a cubed appearance and are predominantly cancellous bone with an outer shell of compact bone. These include the carpals (except for the pisiform – which is sesamoid) and the tarsals (except for the calcaneus which is irregular). 3. Flat bones – thin cancellous bone sandwiched between two compact layers affording protection or large areas for muscle attachment. Examples of these are the scapula, cranial bones, costals (ribs), sternum and ilium. 4. Irregular – form complex shapes and cannot be classified in the other groups. The vertebrae are considered to be irregular and contain varying proportions of compact and cancellous bone. 5. Sesamoid – meaning seed-like, these bones develop within particular tendons at a site of friction or tension. They serve to reduce wear and tear in the tendon and increase leverage of muscle by moving the tendon away from the fulcrum. Examples include the patella (kneecap) and pisiform (carpal bone). Although there are different classifications of bones, a closer analysis of a long bone is useful as it helps highlight many of the properties and functions of the skeletal system. The diagram below shows a cross section of a typical long bone (in this case the humerus). Epiphysis - the bone ends, which are mainly comprised of cancellous bone, and house much of the red marrow involved in red blood cell production. They are also one of the primary sites for bone growth, and during growth periods can be quite vulnerable to breakage. Diaphysis - is the shaft portion of a long bone, and in comparison, to the bone ends is predominantly compact bone (although the inside of the shaft is hollow). The principal role of the diaphysis is support. Epiphyseal plates - are part of the region connecting the diaphysis to the epiphysis. It is a layer of subdividing cartilaginous cells where growth in length of the diaphysis occurs. Multiplying cartilaginous cells are arranged like columns of coins which move towards the diaphysis, becoming more calcified as they go. Osteoblasts will eventually complete the process of bone formation. When adults finish growing the plates will harden and ‘close’, no further growth will take place. If the plates are damaged before growth has finished, then this may result in a shorter bone. However, that little evidence exists that exercise has any effect on bone length in children. Instead it is more likely to lead to broader stronger bones (provided it is accompanied with appropriate diet). Periosteum – this forms a tough fibrous membrane which coats the bone. It contains nerves, blood vessels and bone producing cells. Its inner surface provides the materials for repair and facilitates growth in the diameter of the bone. It also plays a fundamental role in movement by providing the point of attachment for tendons. Medullary cavity – is a space which runs down through the centre of the diaphysis. This contains fatty, yellow marrow which is predominantly composed of adipose tissue, and serves as a useful energy reserve. Articular (hyaline) cartilage – the ends of articulating bones are covered with articular or hyaline cartilage. It is a hard, white shiny tissue which, along with synovial fluid, helps reduce friction in freely moveable (synovial joints). It is fundamental for smooth joint action."

Okay. -- 00:00:27.293 but this particular lecture -- 00:00:27.627 was one -- 00:00:30.163 that I was very interested in hearing. -- 00:00:31.631 He was going to stand up there -- 00:00:32.499 and tell us -- 00:00:34.334 sixth grade basketball players -- 00:00:37.537 how to make it to the NBA. -- 00:00:38.438 Now, when he said -- 00:00:39.239 he was going to teach us this, -- 00:00:40.540 I leaned in, I was ready. -- 00:00:42.042 I was obsessed with basketball -- 00:00:42.642 at that age. -- 00:00:43.843 My favorite player was Shack, -- 00:00:45.011 a big Lakers fan. -- 00:00:46.379 Michael Jordan was in his heyday. -- 00:00:46.946 I mean, it couldn't -- 00:00:49.482 have been a better time, for basketball. -- 00:00:51.184 And I was locked in on getting -- 00:00:52.018 to the NBA. -- 00:00:53.853 I mean, I was so locked into any time -- 00:00:55.388 I had the opportunity to make a wish, -- 00:00:56.056 I was doing it, -- 00:00:57.624 and I was wishing to make the NBA. -- 00:00:59.159 I saw a dandelion in the -- 00:01:00.326 in the grass during the summer. -- 00:01:01.594 I'd rip it out of the ground -- 00:01:02.796 and I wished to myself, -- 00:01:03.596 I want to make the NBA, -- 00:01:04.364 want to make the NBA, -- 00:01:05.498 want to make the NBA. -- 00:01:07.300 And I blow it out on my birthday -- 00:01:08.301 when the candles would be there -- 00:01:09.335 and I'm supposed to make a wish, -- 00:01:10.203 I'd say to myself, -- 00:01:11.171 I want to make the NBA, -- 00:01:12.005 want to make the NBA, -- 00:01:13.640 want to make the NBA. -- 00:01:14.674 When I would be at the mall -- 00:01:15.708 and you'd see the water fountain -- 00:01:17.143 and you flip a coin in there, -- 00:01:18.078 I want to make the NBA -- 00:01:18.778 want to make the NBA. -- 00:01:19.913 I want to make the NBA. -- 00:01:21.347 This was all I could think about. -- 00:01:22.449 It was the only thing -- 00:01:23.883 that consumed my mind. -- 00:01:24.617 So when this coach -- 00:01:25.785 was going to stand up there -- 00:01:26.820 and tell me -- 00:01:29.422 the blueprint on how to make the NBA, -- 00:01:30.857 I was ready to hear. -- 00:01:32.425 So he stood up there. -- 00:01:33.993 The gym was quiet. -- 00:01:35.495 He paced back and forth -- 00:01:40.300 and he said, boys. -- 00:01:43.303 Do you want to know how to make the NBA -- 00:01:45.939 This summer when your friends ask you -- 00:01:47.440 to go to the beach, what do you do? -- 00:01:49.242 You say, no. -- 00:01:50.076 You hang up the phone -- 00:01:51.811 and you go do your drills. -- 00:01:52.679 When your friends ask you -- 00:01:54.080 to go to the movies, what do you do? -- 00:01:55.882 You hang up the phone. You say no. -- 00:01:57.650 You go outside and do your drills. -- 00:01:59.319 You've got to work longer, harder, -- 00:01:59.819 do more. -- 00:02:00.453 You've got to want it -- 00:02:02.856 more than any one of your friends. -- 00:02:04.591 I was ready until I remember. -- 00:02:05.892 In that moment, I made the decision. -- 00:02:07.560 I couldn't believe that he was actually -- 00:02:08.061 telling me -- 00:02:09.162 the real secrets, -- 00:02:10.029 the real steps on -- 00:02:12.699 how to fulfill my childhood dream. -- 00:02:13.800 And I made that decision -- 00:02:15.268 that from then forward, -- 00:02:16.402 I was going to work harder, -- 00:02:18.738 do more, do my drills every single time. -- 00:02:19.639 Later that summer, -- 00:02:21.307 a friend calls me up and say, Sean, -- 00:02:22.308 you want to go to the beach? -- 00:02:23.109 And I like gas. -- 00:02:25.078 I was like, here's my moment. -- 00:02:26.779 No, I don't want to hang up. -- 00:02:28.748 Go outside. Do my drills. -- 00:02:29.516 In the winter, Sean, -- 00:02:30.250 you want to go to the movies? -- 00:02:31.451 No. Can't go outside. -- 00:02:32.952 Snow shovel off the court. -- 00:02:33.820 Do my drills. -- 00:02:34.854 Got to the point where people stop -- 00:02:36.089 asking me to go places -- 00:02:36.956 because I'd always say no. -- 00:02:38.591 And I'd go do my drills, right. -- 00:02:40.093 And I kept working and working -- 00:02:41.060 and working literally -- 00:02:43.129 ever since I was in the sixth grade. -- 00:02:44.330 And I was trying to, you know, -- 00:02:45.465 I made that decision. -- 00:02:46.533 I had been doing hours -- 00:02:47.333 and hours and hours of work -- 00:02:48.501 every single day -- 00:02:50.170 to try to make it to the NBA. -- 00:02:52.438 Now, fast forward years later -- 00:02:54.674 when I finally do make it to the NBA, -- 00:02:55.642 albeit as a strength -- 00:02:57.043 and conditioning coach, -- 00:03:00.146 I was really surprised -- 00:03:01.781 because every single player -- 00:03:03.383 that I was working with -- 00:03:04.918 who had achieved the dream -- 00:03:06.319 that I had spent so many hours -- 00:03:07.554 and grueling in blood, -- 00:03:09.189 sweat and tears poured into this dream -- 00:03:10.690 and was unable to do it. -- 00:03:12.058 Everybody who had fulfilled -- 00:03:12.892 that dream and done -- 00:03:14.827 it did not do what -- 00:03:16.029 that coach told me to do. -- 00:03:20.300 I you most likely, -- 00:03:21.668 and everybody else in this world -- 00:03:23.503 have been sold a lie -- 00:03:24.771 about how to get -- 00:03:26.606 to elite level athletics. -- 00:03:27.907 Now, what I want to teach you -- 00:03:31.811 in this module is that it's not at all -- 00:03:33.513 what you think. -- 00:03:34.881 My first year with the Lakers, -- 00:03:35.415 we had a player on -- 00:03:37.083 our team named Metta World Peace, -- 00:03:38.718 formerly known as Ron -- 00:03:39.352 Artest, -- 00:03:41.254 and Metta had been known, -- 00:03:42.622 had a reputation in the league -- 00:03:44.090 and through the basketball circles -- 00:03:46.693 as being the strongest guy in the NBA. -- 00:03:47.327 Now he's a little bit -- 00:03:48.661 before LeBron James there -- 00:03:50.330 when he became the strongest guy. -- 00:03:51.965 But for years and years and years, -- 00:03:52.432 he was known -- 00:03:54.300 as the strongest guy in the NBA, -- 00:03:56.135 the NBA Defensive Player of the year. -- 00:03:56.569 And I remember -- 00:03:58.238 seeing like he would be Deing -- 00:03:58.938 somebody up -- 00:04:00.039 and a guy would try to make a move -- 00:04:01.741 and he would just put his hand down here -- 00:04:02.408 and guide him, -- 00:04:03.576 move him off his spot -- 00:04:04.577 and just manhandle -- 00:04:06.279 and do whatever he wanted with them. -- 00:04:08.348 Now you've also got to understand this. -- 00:04:09.549 These are NBA players. -- 00:04:10.149 These are professional -- 00:04:11.117 basketball players. -- 00:04:12.819 He's not just moving a little guy off. -- 00:04:13.419 It's moving a guy who's -- 00:04:15.054 six foot nine, six foot ten, -- 00:04:18.491 270 pounds of pure athletic muscle. -- 00:04:20.193 Just get out. -- 00:04:21.561 I'll do what I want with you. -- 00:04:23.329 The strongest guy in the NBA. -- 00:04:24.864 So one day, he walks in the weight room. -- 00:04:26.366 He says, Sean, I want a lift. -- 00:04:27.267 And I was like, awesome. -- 00:04:28.501 So I pull out his file, -- 00:04:29.502 we pull up what he's got. -- 00:04:30.403 He goes through his warm up -- 00:04:32.438 and right at the top of his block -- 00:04:34.140 was dumbbell bench. -- 00:04:35.008 And I was like, all right. -- 00:04:36.676 Strongest dude in the NBA right here. -- 00:04:37.377 Let's see what he's got. -- 00:04:38.678 So he -- 00:04:39.679 goes over to the dumbbell rack -- 00:04:41.881 and he grabs a couple of 80s okay. -- 00:04:43.816 Sits down on the on the bench, -- 00:04:44.917 puts him on his knees. -- 00:04:45.618 One hoists -- 00:04:47.020 one up hoists the other one up. -- 00:04:49.856 Lays back one rep got it. -- 00:04:51.791 Two rep. Got it. -- 00:04:52.392 Three rep. -- 00:04:54.294 Looking a little slow. -- 00:04:56.829 Fourth rep looking a little shaky. -- 00:04:59.165 The fifth rep gets about halfway. -- 00:05:00.733 Crumbles. Weights fall out. -- 00:05:01.367 He's done. -- 00:05:02.335 Can't go any further. -- 00:05:04.637 I'm sitting there going -- 00:05:06.172 I thought this was the strongest player -- 00:05:07.507 in the NBA right? -- 00:05:08.374 All of my strength -- 00:05:09.442 and conditioning coach friends. -- 00:05:11.544 The warming up with 80s, right? -- 00:05:13.813 So I had to ask myself the question, -- 00:05:16.149 what is real strength? -- 00:05:18.651 Is it strength on a four week -- 00:05:20.320 training block, -- 00:05:21.688 like our strength coaches -- 00:05:23.089 we're programing -- 00:05:25.825 or is there a difference in terms of -- 00:05:27.060 real strength -- 00:05:30.396 as applied to their athletic endeavor? -- 00:05:31.531 And in that moment, -- 00:05:32.598 I realized -- 00:05:35.468 that not all strength is created equal. -- 00:05:37.837 And what I want to teach you here in -- 00:05:39.305 this module is -- 00:05:41.441 what is real athletic strength. -- 00:05:42.909 And it all comes down to one thing, -- 00:05:44.711 and that is gait mechanics, -- 00:05:47.080 walking mechanics, -- 00:05:48.548 which is simply -- 00:05:50.950 your ability to be on right stance -- 00:05:51.951 and all the muscles of right -- 00:05:53.252 single leg stance turn on, -- 00:05:54.687 then flip it over the left stance. -- 00:05:56.189 All the muscles of left single leg -- 00:05:57.857 stance turn on while this side -- 00:05:59.092 turns off and vice versa, -- 00:06:00.193 and be able to fluctuate -- 00:06:02.528 going back and forth, back and forth. -- 00:06:02.962 And best of all, -- 00:06:03.730 he needs to go from right -- 00:06:04.597 stance, left and right -- 00:06:05.631 stance to left stance. -- 00:06:08.034 He didn't need to load up a barbell -- 00:06:09.369 and just jam out -- 00:06:09.936 as many reps -- 00:06:11.704 at as high amount of weight and volume -- 00:06:13.272 as he possibly can. -- 00:06:15.608 He needs to take those elite movement -- 00:06:17.643 biomechanics and athleticism -- 00:06:20.680 and paste strength on top of that. -- 00:06:21.381 Have you ever heard -- 00:06:23.015 the phrase don't paste strength -- 00:06:24.517 on top of dysfunction? -- 00:06:25.518 This is it. -- 00:06:28.020 This is where elite athletics were born. -- 00:06:29.489 So when you start looking forward, -- 00:06:30.189 and this is what we're going -- 00:06:32.058 to reveal to you here in this section, -- 00:06:33.393 when you start looking forward, -- 00:06:34.327 you've got to first -- 00:06:35.361 ask yourself, -- 00:06:37.697 is this person moving at an elite level? -- 00:06:38.931 Are there restrictions -- 00:06:40.299 inside of this person's -- 00:06:41.934 this athlete's gait mechanics? -- 00:06:42.568 If there are -- 00:06:44.203 we've got to remove those first -- 00:06:46.572 and then only then -- 00:06:48.508 do we appreciate the mechanics -- 00:06:49.175 of gate mechanics, -- 00:06:51.778 the prime movers of gait mechanics, -- 00:06:53.346 and then put strength -- 00:06:55.448 functionally into that, -- 00:06:57.150 into that process. -- 00:06:58.351 Then and only then -- 00:07:00.353 are we elevating that athlete into the -- 00:07:02.155 into the echelon of the elite. -- 00:07:02.655 And that's what -- 00:07:04.891 I want to reveal to you here in this -- 00:07:06.459 in this module. -- 00:07:08.027 Ready to learn that stuff. -- 00:07:08.661 All right. Let's go. In 2017 when I was working as a Strength and Conditioning Coach for the Los Angeles Lakers, Metta World Peace (formerly Ron Artest) walked into the weight room one afternoon for a workout. I had been a HUGE basketball fan for my entire life so when I first met these guys, I already knew everything about them. Metta was long considered the strongest player in the NBA. Whenever I would tune into a game, they would talk about how hard it was to get around him and how he could control some of the best players in the world with just his hands. And these aren’t small guys that he’s “manhandling.” These are GIANTS! 7-feet tall! 300+ pounds! In fact, he won the NBA Defensive Player of the Year back in 2004. “What have we got today?” Metta asked me. I pulled out his workout program and went over it with him. The first thing on the sheet was “Dumbbell Bench.” Metta walked over to the dumbbell rack, grabbed the 80’s and sat down on the bench. What happened next was unexpected. He struggled. Once he had the dumbbells in position, he barely got them off his chest. Once they were up, you could tell that he was really pushing his limits. I was shocked. Most of my Strength Coach buddies were warming up with 80’s and this is supposed to be the strongest guy in the entire NBA? He barely got five reps. This was a real eye opener to me about what REAL strength is. This made me start to question my beliefs about what kind of training REALLY translates to sport performance. After working with the most prominent athletes on our planet for nearly a decade, I can emphatically tell you that weight room strength and functional strength are not the same. Every movement of the body operates under gait (walking) mechanics. Do you know how the body moves your food down your esophagus and down into your stomach? By an alternating, side to side motion. That’s gait. Gait Mechanics = Functional Training…period. When you think about it, it's logical since 13 out of 16 movements in a HYROX race are unilateral alternating movements: 8x running 1 kilometer, Sled Push, Sled Pull, Burpee Broad Jumps, Farmers Carries, and Sandbag Lunges. Even exercises that seem bilateral, like SkiErg, RowErg, and WallBalls, aren't, as you'll learn by the end of this chapter. It's all based on unilateral strength, as nothing else matters! I’ve seen it what it can do with NBA players… I’ve seen what it can do for MLB players… I’ve seen what it can do for HYROX athletes from around the world… Now, I’m going to show you what it can do for you. Chapter: Every System of the Body Uses these Three Secrets as its Foundation --> 00:00:08.441 I spent my entire --> 00:00:11.311 childhood obsessed with the NBA --> 00:00:12.846 and how I was going to get there. --> 00:00:14.514 Now, I didn't get there as a player, --> 00:00:15.115 but eventually --> 00:00:16.082 I did become the strength --> 00:00:17.350 and conditioning coach --> 00:00:19.319 of the Los Angeles Lakers, --> 00:00:21.755 which is a pretty good runner up prize. --> 00:00:24.391 Yeah, but so I had to turn my attention --> 00:00:25.458 from being obsessed --> 00:00:26.693 with playing basketball --> 00:00:29.529 to learning how to manufacture --> 00:00:32.198 elite level athletics, specifically --> 00:00:32.932 in basketball. --> 00:00:33.533 Now, aside --> 00:00:36.069 from the obvious perks of that job, --> 00:00:36.603 there's a perk --> 00:00:38.805 that you may not realize that a lot of us --> 00:00:39.939 NBA strength or conditioning --> 00:00:41.307 coaches were able to get. --> 00:00:43.176 Now, because of the 82 game season, --> 00:00:44.177 there's not a lot of time --> 00:00:45.845 for you to squeeze in your workouts. --> 00:00:47.147 So a lot of the players would workout --> 00:00:49.516 before the game or after the game. --> 00:00:50.850 So we would be in the arena --> 00:00:52.685 and we'd have to go to the weight room --> 00:00:54.287 in the arena to work out. --> 00:00:55.355 Now, a lot of the times, --> 00:00:58.024 especially in LA at the Staples Center, --> 00:00:59.759 now the Crypto.com Arena, --> 00:01:01.194 I believe, yeah, --> 00:01:02.662 we had just one weight room. --> 00:01:03.630 Which meant that whoever --> 00:01:05.331 we were playing against who, --> 00:01:06.399 when they were going to come lift, --> 00:01:07.801 they had to come to our weight --> 00:01:10.804 room, my office to train, which meant --> 00:01:12.972 that I got a front row seat --> 00:01:14.007 to every single --> 00:01:16.209 NBA players warm up, --> 00:01:17.744 corrective exercises, --> 00:01:19.079 strength training routines, --> 00:01:20.246 conditioning routines, --> 00:01:21.347 how they got locked in. --> 00:01:23.249 When the Cleveland Cavaliers --> 00:01:24.117 traveled across --> 00:01:25.585 the country to Los Angeles --> 00:01:26.352 and they were going to play --> 00:01:27.654 us, the Lakers, --> 00:01:29.589 I got to see LeBron James train. --> 00:01:31.091 I got to see Kyrie Irving, --> 00:01:32.092 Kevin Love train. --> 00:01:33.226 I was in the same weight room --> 00:01:34.194 as Vince Carter, Klay --> 00:01:35.595 Thompson, Steph Curry, --> 00:01:36.329 Kevin Durant --> 00:01:37.230 and I got to see how --> 00:01:38.731 every single one of them --> 00:01:39.766 go through their process. --> 00:01:41.468 I got to see what exercises they used. --> 00:01:42.669 I got to see how many reps, --> 00:01:44.237 how many sets I could talk to them. --> 00:01:45.271 I could talk to the strength coach. --> 00:01:46.539 I would be in these conversations --> 00:01:48.842 with Hall of Fame basketball players, --> 00:01:51.845 getting to see how the sausage gets made. --> 00:01:53.346 And like I said before, --> 00:01:54.080 it's a lot different --> 00:01:54.881 than you would think. --> 00:01:56.883 It's a lot different than I thought. --> 00:02:00.220 And what we learned in the last modules --> 00:02:02.589 that it all comes down to gait mechanics, --> 00:02:04.991 walking mechanics, that's the foundation. --> 00:02:07.627 Can you move with elite mechanics? --> 00:02:10.063 That's how all of these NBA players --> 00:02:13.066 are starting their movement programs. --> 00:02:14.434 And what I want to show you, --> 00:02:16.569 and I want to break down for you in this, --> 00:02:18.938 in this entire section of the course, is --> 00:02:22.542 I want to show you how to manufacture --> 00:02:24.878 elite biomechanics in elite --> 00:02:26.146 gait mechanics, --> 00:02:27.580 which means that you can make it --> 00:02:28.414 if you have somebody --> 00:02:30.216 who is not there yet, --> 00:02:31.718 you can manufacture, --> 00:02:32.619 you can create it --> 00:02:34.287 if you understand how to do that. --> 00:02:36.189 So there's really three things --> 00:02:37.757 that I need to teach you here. --> 00:02:39.125 These are the three secrets --> 00:02:39.993 I call them --> 00:02:41.161 to producing elite level --> 00:02:43.329 athletics through gate mechanics. --> 00:02:44.964 The first thing is we have to --> 00:02:46.533 we have to understand --> 00:02:50.770 how to unlock every morsel of athleticism --> 00:02:52.205 that you have been blessed --> 00:02:53.406 with, that you were born with --> 00:02:55.341 whatever is in your genetic pool. --> 00:02:58.344 We need to be able to access every last --> 00:02:59.746 ounce of it. Okay. --> 00:03:00.613 And that's the first thing --> 00:03:01.514 that we're going to teach you. --> 00:03:01.915 You're going to learn --> 00:03:03.216 about a program that I call --> 00:03:04.617 Operation Gen Max. --> 00:03:06.486 How do we get somebody an athlete --> 00:03:10.123 to unlock their genetic maximum output? --> 00:03:10.390 Okay. --> 00:03:11.191 That's the first thing --> 00:03:12.425 that we've got to teach you. --> 00:03:13.359 The second thing --> 00:03:14.194 that I've got to teach you. --> 00:03:16.095 The second secret to this process is --> 00:03:19.599 how do we unlock that last 10%? --> 00:03:21.668 Really anybody with a weekend --> 00:03:23.102 certification is going to be able --> 00:03:26.105 to get a newbie to to get better --> 00:03:27.040 and unlock --> 00:03:30.043 their first like 80, 75, 80, 90%. --> 00:03:30.643 But what happens --> 00:03:32.078 when you hit that plateau? --> 00:03:34.514 How do you get an elite athlete better? --> 00:03:37.250 How do you unlock that final 10% --> 00:03:38.618 to push them over the edge, --> 00:03:40.019 to get them into the --> 00:03:42.288 to get them into the elites? Okay. --> 00:03:43.423 And then the last thing --> 00:03:45.458 I've got to teach you is --> 00:03:47.093 how to put it all back together again, --> 00:03:48.728 how to assemble a training program, --> 00:03:51.731 how to prioritize and execute the needs --> 00:03:52.832 of an athlete --> 00:03:54.000 to prioritize and execute --> 00:03:55.902 the needs of gait mechanics. --> 00:03:56.703 Now, one of the things --> 00:03:57.670 that's so interesting is --> 00:03:59.706 we learn the human body --> 00:04:01.140 in sections, right? --> 00:04:02.141 It makes it easier to learn. --> 00:04:03.643 It makes it easier to digest. --> 00:04:04.611 But we can't forget --> 00:04:05.812 about the most important piece, --> 00:04:07.847 the most important piece, --> 00:04:09.949 which is putting it all back together. --> 00:04:11.184 The body does not work --> 00:04:12.385 in independent sections. --> 00:04:15.455 It works as one whole collective unit. --> 00:04:16.623 We have to be able to understand --> 00:04:17.090 how to do that. --> 00:04:18.057 So those are the three secrets --> 00:04:19.359 that we need to teach you here, --> 00:04:21.060 so that you have a great understanding --> 00:04:23.029 of how to manufacture --> 00:04:24.897 elite level athletics. --> 00:04:26.165 Operation Gen Max, --> 00:04:28.401 how do we unlock every ounce of ability --> 00:04:29.168 you have? --> 00:04:29.936 Number two, --> 00:04:31.904 how do you unlock that last 10%? --> 00:04:33.406 And then how do you take all of this --> 00:04:35.074 new information --> 00:04:36.175 and put it back together again? --> 00:04:37.977 You ready to learn this stuff? Let's go. My mission over the next few lessons is to convince you of just one thing…That training to optimize gait mechanics is the only way that you should train your athletes for HYROX. To really prove that to you, I’d like to take you on a journey through the three secrets optimal performance. These secrets were hard to come by. These secrets are not readily available to the ordinary Joe. These secrets are locked behind the closed doors of the professional sports teams’ training facilities. Unless you’ve been on the other side of that door, you go along your career without every knowing these things existed. What a shame that would be! Thankfully, I have penetrated the castles, and I have returned with a bag full of tricks and a book full of secrets that I’m going to share with you. The first secret I’m going to tell you about is, how to unlock someone’s absolute maximum genetic potential. You can imagine how important this was to me as an NBA Strength and Conditioning Coach. When I worked for the Lakers, I had to get my guys ready to play against legends like LeBron James, Kevin Durant and Stephen Curry. That’s no small task. This is competition of the highest caliber. There’s no room for slacking off. There’s no room for guessing. I must be absolutely certain I know how to squeeze every last drop out of my athletes, so they are not embarrassed on national television. The second secret I’m going to share with you may be the most important. Most coaches use very general science. Sure, it will work for the ordinary person, but what about someone who is already elite? Just exercising more won’t get the job done. Therefore, the second secret will show you how to exercise with elite intelligence and unlock the last 10% of performance gains. When I released my book earlier this year, I wrote about the trouble with the education system today. Because the human body is so complex, our schools break it down into many different parts. This is why we have podiatrists (foot doctors), optometrists (eye doctors), and neurosurgeons (brain surgeons). But they’ve missed the most important part…putting it all back together again! One of the great advantages of being an athletic and fitness coach is the opportunity to bring it all together and treat the body as a whole. Which, by the way, is exactly how the body is supposed to be treated. The final secret that I must relay to you is simple: How are you going to execute all of this? If I listened to every influencer and coach out there telling me what to do, I’d be working out, doing mobility exercises or warming up twenty-four hours a day! The final secret that I must relay to you is simple: How are you going to execute all of this? If I listened to every influencer and coach out there telling me what to do, I’d be working out, doing mobility exercises or warming up twenty-four hours a day! How can you effectively prioritize your training needs and create hyper-efficient programs all revolving around that one thing I’ve got to convince you of… That training to optimize gait mechanics is the only way that you should be training for HYROX. Chapter: Anatomy Review --> 00:00:08.475 What I'm --> 00:00:11.478 about to teach you --> 00:00:14.447 has the ability and should --> 00:00:15.815 profoundly change the way --> 00:00:17.817 that you look at the human body. --> 00:00:19.919 In the general population, --> 00:00:20.720 in HYROX --> 00:00:22.288 athletes, in athletes, --> 00:00:23.523 in absolutely --> 00:00:24.791 anybody that you deal with --> 00:00:26.326 for the rest of your life. --> 00:00:26.459 Now, --> 00:00:27.927 even when I speak at high --> 00:00:29.662 level universities, --> 00:00:32.298 conventions, conferences, seminars, --> 00:00:34.901 people don't know, even the highest level --> 00:00:37.904 coaches are unaware of this very simple --> 00:00:40.974 and anatomical anomaly, that, --> 00:00:44.978 if understood and appreciated, --> 00:00:48.915 absolutely has to create a seismic shift --> 00:00:52.685 in how you are programing, the exercise --> 00:00:54.521 selection, the rep scheme, --> 00:00:55.889 the set scheme. --> 00:00:57.257 Everything needs to change, --> 00:00:58.558 when you understand --> 00:00:59.626 that the human body --> 00:01:01.961 is built asymmetrical. --> 00:01:02.862 The right side --> 00:01:04.898 and the left side are not one --> 00:01:06.266 and the same. Here's what I mean. --> 00:01:08.968 If I were to take a chainsaw --> 00:01:10.737 and cut myself open here --> 00:01:13.039 and then look down on the human body, --> 00:01:14.107 I would be able to see --> 00:01:15.809 the diaphragm of the body. --> 00:01:17.077 Now, the diaphragm is a dome. --> 00:01:19.512 So if I take my rib cage, put it here. --> 00:01:20.513 It's a dome --> 00:01:22.382 that sits inside of your rib cage. --> 00:01:23.149 Every time you breathe, --> 00:01:25.485 every time you inhale, it descends. --> 00:01:26.920 Every time you exhale, --> 00:01:29.189 it ascend, that comes up higher, right… --> 00:01:30.390 Now, the right side --> 00:01:32.292 and the left side of the diaphragm --> 00:01:33.626 are not the same. --> 00:01:35.562 If I'm looking down on my chain --> 00:01:37.230 sawed off rib cage, --> 00:01:39.399 what I'm going to see is a right --> 00:01:41.568 lobe of my diaphragm. --> 00:01:42.769 Big, strong, --> 00:01:43.636 robust, --> 00:01:46.673 meaty, red, a lot of muscle fibers. --> 00:01:48.808 If I look down on my left side, --> 00:01:50.777 I'm going to see this tiny, --> 00:01:54.547 wider, more tenderness, pushing back way --> 00:01:58.218 less far tiny diaphragm on the left side. --> 00:01:59.052 Now, if we're just looking --> 00:01:59.819 at that overhead view, --> 00:02:00.954 we're going to say, okay, --> 00:02:01.688 from about from --> 00:02:03.223 just a vacuum perspective here, --> 00:02:03.923 the right side --> 00:02:04.724 and the left side --> 00:02:06.459 are not the same, right? --> 00:02:08.061 If we look at some other asymmetries, --> 00:02:09.229 it goes even further. --> 00:02:09.796 We start seeing --> 00:02:10.930 how the right side of the diaphragm --> 00:02:13.066 pushes all the way back to the rib cage, --> 00:02:14.567 to the back of your rib cage, --> 00:02:15.768 whereas on the left side, --> 00:02:17.403 there's a huge gap --> 00:02:19.072 between the back of the diaphragm --> 00:02:20.240 and the --> 00:02:21.441 and the start of the back --> 00:02:22.509 of your rib cage. Right? --> 00:02:23.643 If you're looking at it again, --> 00:02:24.277 it looks like --> 00:02:26.112 it's tilted over to the right. --> 00:02:27.113 Additionally, --> 00:02:28.281 underneath the diaphragm --> 00:02:30.483 on your right side is your liver. --> 00:02:32.051 Liver is only on the right side --> 00:02:33.219 of the body, it’s not on the left. --> 00:02:34.754 So because of that, --> 00:02:35.889 the diaphragm is sitting --> 00:02:37.023 on top of the liver on the right, --> 00:02:37.690 not on the left. --> 00:02:39.459 So now it sits a little bit higher --> 00:02:40.560 on the right side --> 00:02:41.661 than it does on the left. --> 00:02:43.129 Now I want you to think about bicep curls --> 00:02:43.997 here, okay. --> 00:02:46.332 If I'm going full range of motion --> 00:02:47.734 I'm going to be able to bicep curl --> 00:02:49.502 40 pounds. Okay? --> 00:02:50.537 But if I'm doing it --> 00:02:52.105 from this range of motion, --> 00:02:52.906 how much weight am I going --> 00:02:53.873 to be able to pull --> 00:02:57.010 75, 80 pounds. --> 00:02:57.977 It's because what's happened --> 00:02:58.945 is I've shortened --> 00:03:00.747 the fibers of the muscle, --> 00:03:02.849 and I've given it leverage to contract. --> 00:03:04.951 Because it sits on top of the dia… on on --> 00:03:06.586 top of the liver, on the right side, --> 00:03:08.354 it shortens the fibers --> 00:03:10.523 and it gives it leverage to contract on. --> 00:03:12.659 Additionally, the heart, --> 00:03:14.694 the heart on the left side of the body, --> 00:03:16.362 it's pressing down on the diaphragm, --> 00:03:17.597 doing the complete opposite --> 00:03:18.331 de-leveraging --> 00:03:19.732 and making the fibers longer. --> 00:03:22.402 So now we're looking at a diaphragm --> 00:03:23.903 that is positionally, --> 00:03:27.540 that is anatomically more leveraged --> 00:03:30.076 for contraction on the right side --> 00:03:31.144 than the left side. --> 00:03:32.679 Now here's where it gets good: --> 00:03:34.047 Every time that you breathe, --> 00:03:36.349 which is 20,000 times every single day. --> 00:03:37.717 If you're running a HYROX, --> 00:03:39.419 you're breathing 30,000, --> 00:03:40.987 40,000 times every day. --> 00:03:41.588 Now, every time --> 00:03:42.956 that you take a breath in, --> 00:03:44.190 there's a game of tug of war --> 00:03:46.359 that's happening between the right side --> 00:03:48.027 and the left side of the body. --> 00:03:49.862 Now, every time you breathe, --> 00:03:51.097 which is again, --> 00:03:54.400 20,000 times every single day, --> 00:03:56.502 who's winning that game of tug --> 00:03:58.071 of war all 20,000 times? --> 00:04:00.707 It's the right side. --> 00:04:01.174 Right. --> 00:04:02.575 And then over time, what happens is --> 00:04:02.976 you produce --> 00:04:04.777 a slight twist to the right side --> 00:04:07.747 every single time. --> 00:04:10.583 Eventually, the right side --> 00:04:12.385 gets so good at turning on, --> 00:04:13.653 the left side gets so good --> 00:04:14.354 at staying off, --> 00:04:15.054 that even if you tried --> 00:04:16.089 to get over to the left side, --> 00:04:17.323 you're not going to be able to get there --> 00:04:19.359 because you're putting an absurd amount --> 00:04:20.093 of repetitions --> 00:04:21.461 on the right side versus the left. --> 00:04:23.563 Imagine if I took a dumbbell here --> 00:04:23.896 and I did --> 00:04:26.399 20,000 reps of bicep curls --> 00:04:28.001 every single day, just on my right side. --> 00:04:29.235 Imagine the difference --> 00:04:30.670 between my right side and my left side. --> 00:04:32.338 That's exactly what's happening --> 00:04:34.140 when you're talking about respiration. --> 00:04:35.408 Now look, here's --> 00:04:37.477 where programing comes into play. --> 00:04:39.012 Most people when I go to --> 00:04:40.213 when I go to a commercial gym, --> 00:04:41.848 if I stop in on a training session --> 00:04:42.749 for another coach, --> 00:04:44.917 what I'm seeing is bilateral exercises. --> 00:04:45.118 Right? --> 00:04:47.086 Now, the contention in a squat --> 00:04:48.688 and a deadlift and a clean --> 00:04:51.457 and any of those exercises, my contention --> 00:04:53.593 is that I'm getting 50% action --> 00:04:54.560 on my right side --> 00:04:56.763 and 50% action on my left. --> 00:04:58.765 But now, with this new understanding --> 00:04:59.599 of the human body --> 00:05:00.600 and the anatomy that's --> 00:05:02.168 sitting under the surface, --> 00:05:05.338 is that possible? --> 00:05:06.205 No way. --> 00:05:07.240 If I'm squatting, --> 00:05:08.808 if I'm benching, if I'm deadlifting, --> 00:05:10.843 if I'm doing any bilateral exercise, --> 00:05:11.811 meaning both arms --> 00:05:13.713 or both legs at the same time, --> 00:05:16.015 the right side is so leveraged --> 00:05:17.684 to dominate that movement --> 00:05:18.017 that you're --> 00:05:19.719 just going to drive yourself further --> 00:05:20.553 and further --> 00:05:23.589 and further into a right side dominant --> 00:05:26.125 human being and right side --> 00:05:27.493 dominant athlete. --> 00:05:29.562 Now, as an athlete, as a person, --> 00:05:32.632 we need, we crave, we want optimal --> 00:05:34.534 health is a right side and a left side --> 00:05:36.336 that is acting symmetrically. --> 00:05:37.270 It's the same on the right side --> 00:05:38.438 versus the left. --> 00:05:40.239 But in order to gain symmetry, --> 00:05:41.574 we know that the training approach --> 00:05:43.276 now must be asymmetrical --> 00:05:45.611 because the left side needs to catch up, --> 00:05:48.614 it needs to do more just to be even. --> 00:05:49.148 Okay. --> 00:05:50.249 And I want you to think about --> 00:05:51.517 how that is going to change --> 00:05:52.418 your programing --> 00:05:53.186 going forward, --> 00:05:54.387 knowing that the left side --> 00:05:56.422 is always going to be behind the right, --> 00:05:58.424 unless you're giving it more action, --> 00:06:00.059 more love, spending more time --> 00:06:01.194 on the left side --> 00:06:02.328 than you are on the right --> 00:06:03.830 so that they can ultimately tip --> 00:06:05.398 the scales and be even. --> 00:06:06.699 When you look at programing --> 00:06:07.567 going forward, --> 00:06:08.968 when you look at conditioning --> 00:06:09.702 going forward, --> 00:06:11.337 when you look at anything --> 00:06:12.438 that you're going to put inside --> 00:06:13.706 of a training program, --> 00:06:14.841 you have to understand that --> 00:06:16.142 if you want symmetry, --> 00:06:17.777 you have to have an asymmetrical --> 00:06:18.945 training approach. --> 00:06:20.813 And that's what I want you to understand --> 00:06:22.715 as we progress here in this module. Okay? I’m going to tell you something that I’ve never told anyone before: What I do for a living ain’t that difficult. I own and operate an Athletic Restoration Clinic on the Upper East Side of Manhattan where people come from far and wide to get my expertise.I have clients from Singapore, Dubai, Australia and I even have a client who commutes back and forth from San Francisco. I have billionaire clients. I have professional athletes, world champions and Olympians. And it’s all smoke and mirrors! Allow me to explain. Everyone is coming to me with some sort of pain. The usual stuff. Back pain Knie pain Plantar Frascatis Shoulder Pain Headaches etc. Most of them have been to dozens of specialists who can’t figure it out. I even have clients who have tried spiritual healers and psychics to try and fix their pain. But nothing has worked. That’s usually when they find themselves in my office. 90% of my clients are symptom free within 30 days. So, what is this voodoo that I’m giving them? I’m teaching them how to exercise properly. More specifically, I’m teaching them how to train their gait mechanics. The first question that I always ask is “What are your workouts like?” I’m trying to understand what they are doing in the gym. Most men tell me some combination of bench press, squat and deadlifts. I’ve also noticed that dips are oddly common amongst the men complaining of pain. Most women tell me some combination of Pilates, Yoga, Barre and other similar classes. What do these activities all have in common, they focus on bilateral movement. But there is no such thing as a bilateral movement. Why is that? It is because the right side of our diaphragm is bigger and stronger than the left – it’s that simple and still has such a huge impact on everything we do in training and competition as well as in everyday life. It’s time to show you why that’s something you should never forget. The diaphragm is your breathing muscle. When you inhale, the diaphragm contracts and moves downwards. When you exhale it relaxes and moves back upwards. The illustration shows a superior view of the diaphragm, the primary muscle used in the process of breathing. The diaphragm is depicted as a dome-shaped muscle that separates the thoracic cavity from the abdominal cavity. When you inhale, the diaphragm contracts and moves downwards. When you exhale it relaxes and moves back upwards. Every time you breathe, which is upwards of 20,000 times a day and might even be 30,000 or 40,000 times during a HYROX competition, a tug of war begins between the right and left sides of the diaphragm. Up until now, you would have assumed that they are pulling with equal strength. But now that you’re taking the time to educate yourself, you might realize that they are not, The right diaphragm is much stronger than the left. So each time you inhale, all 20,000 to 40,000 times, the right diaphragm will slightly pull your ribcage to the right when you breathe. You can imagine the imbalance that might create after decades of not realizing this! The frontal view of the diaphragm highlights its dome-shaped structure, which forms a crucial partition between the thoracic and abdominal cavities. This muscle is essential for respiration, contracting and flattening during inhalation to allow the lungs to expand and relax during exhalation to expel air. The diaphragm attaches to the lower ribs, sternum, and lumbar vertebrae, and it contains openings for essential structures like the esophagus, aorta, and inferior vena cava to pass between the thorax and abdomen. Key Points: The Right Side of the Diaphragm is Bigger and Stronger than the Left Each Time You Inhale, the Stronger Right Diaphragm Twists the Body to the Right Now, there is some complexity here and I encourage you to stick around and move on to Level 2 of the HYROX Academy when you’re ready to really unpack this information but for now, I just want you to start seeing the differences between the right and left side of the body. Stop and think for a moment about the most common exercises like Squat Bench Press Deadlift Each of these exercises are bilateral. Meaning you do both sides at the same time. The contention here is that 50% of the work will go to your right side and the other 50% to your left. But given what you now know about the human body, is that actually possible? No chance! The right side will always win because it has an advantage over the left. So here’s the big light bulb moment: BILATERAL EXERCISES DO NOT EXIST! If you were to perform a squat, bench or deadlift, you will be performing a right-side biased exercise. Now, don’t get confused. All I want you to understand is this: If you are going to train the body functionally, it has to be unilateral. Meaning one side at a time. That’s just how the body was designed. There will be more time in Level 2 to really dive into this more, but for now, stick to understanding that unilateral exercises are the only functional way to train. HYROX has emerged as a phenomenal successful sport and training concept precisely because it is inherently aligned with the principles of functional movement and unilateral strength. Unlike traditional weightlifting or bodybuilding, which often focus on bilateral exercises, HYROX emphasizes movements that mirror natural human biomechanics, making it not only effective but also safe and sustainable. One of the standout features of HYROX is its reliance on unilateral exercises. These are movements that train one side of the body at a time, which is crucial for developing balanced strength and stability. For instance, when you perform a lunge or a single-leg deadlift, you're not just building muscle; you're also enhancing the coordination and strength of each leg independently. This translates to better overall performance and reduces the risk of injury by ensuring that both sides of your body are equally strong and capable. In HYROX competitions, athletes engage in a variety of movements that require unilateral strength and control. This includes exercises like the Sled Push, Sled Pull, Farmers Carry, Sandbag Lunges, and the Burpee Broad Jump. Each of these exercises challenges the body to maintain stability and generate power through a series of coordinated, unilateral movements. This is not just about lifting weights; it's about moving efficiently and effectively, using the body's natural mechanics to optimize performance. Moreover, the focus on gait mechanics in HYROX further underscores its effectiveness as a training concept. Gait mechanics involve the study of how the body moves during walking and running, emphasizing the importance of unilateral and alternating movements. By training in a way that enhances gait mechanics, HYROX athletes can improve their overall movement efficiency, endurance, and power. This holistic approach ensures that every muscle, joint, and tendon is working in harmony, leading to superior athletic performance. The versatility of HYROX also makes it an excellent training regimen for a wide range of athletes. Whether you're a professional competitor or someone looking to improve your general fitness, the principles of unilateral strength and functional movement in HYROX can help you achieve your goals. The sport's emphasis on real-world movements means that the benefits extend beyond the gym, improving everyday activities and overall quality of life. In summary, HYROX is a great sport and training concept because it aligns with the body's anatomical asymmetries and natural biomechanics, emphasizing unilateral strength and functional movement. This not only enhances athletic performance but also promotes balanced strength and reduces the risk of injury. By focusing on movements that mimic real-life activities, HYROX offers a comprehensive and effective approach to fitness that benefits athletes of all levels. Chapter: Operation genMAX --> 00:00:09.609 I think the year was 2000 --> 00:00:13.380 and maybe the maybe the winter of 2013. --> 00:00:15.048 It was the offseason --> 00:00:16.116 of professional baseball. --> 00:00:17.684 I just finished up my first year, --> 00:00:18.752 working as a strength coach --> 00:00:19.719 for the Arizona Diamondbacks. --> 00:00:21.254 My brother was a first round --> 00:00:22.389 pick for the Boston Red Sox, --> 00:00:23.490 and he had just finished, --> 00:00:25.692 I believe, his second year in the Boston --> 00:00:26.860 Red Sox minor league system. --> 00:00:28.928 Now, my brother, was --> 00:00:31.131 he was originally a starting pitcher, --> 00:00:32.232 which means that he had to go --> 00:00:32.932 seven, eight, --> 00:00:33.533 nine innings --> 00:00:35.168 over the course of 100 pitches. --> 00:00:36.569 But in that offseason, --> 00:00:38.138 the Red Sox organization told him --> 00:00:39.939 that they were going to transition him --> 00:00:41.041 to being a closer, --> 00:00:41.541 which meant that --> 00:00:42.008 instead of throwing --> 00:00:43.443 100 pitches in the game, --> 00:00:45.378 he was going to be throwing 9 --> 00:00:46.646 or 10 pitches, right? --> 00:00:48.214 So instead of having to work --> 00:00:49.916 for an hour and a half, two hours --> 00:00:51.084 now he was only going to have to work --> 00:00:52.485 for just a few minutes, --> 00:00:54.554 which dramatically changed what we needed --> 00:00:56.523 to do inside of a training program --> 00:00:57.857 in terms of conditioning, --> 00:00:58.825 in terms of power, --> 00:01:00.493 in terms of everything. Right? --> 00:01:01.995 So my brother comes to me --> 00:01:03.430 at the beginning of that offseason --> 00:01:04.097 and we always talk, --> 00:01:04.931 okay, what are the goals? --> 00:01:05.565 What do you need to do? --> 00:01:06.399 What do you need to be better at? --> 00:01:07.500 How did you feel on the mound? --> 00:01:08.968 What did we need to adjust? --> 00:01:11.171 And he says to me, Sean, --> 00:01:12.405 I've got a big one for you --> 00:01:14.174 for this, this offseason. --> 00:01:17.243 I don't want to throw 100 miles an hour. --> 00:01:20.647 I want to throw faster than 100 miles --> 00:01:20.914 an hour. --> 00:01:21.815 Now, at the time, --> 00:01:23.817 I think he was probably topping out --> 00:01:27.153 at 97, maybe a 98 here and there. --> 00:01:29.155 But now he wants to, you know, --> 00:01:30.056 not only the additional --> 00:01:32.058 two miles an hour to hit triple digits, --> 00:01:32.692 but he wants to go --> 00:01:33.493 even further than that. --> 00:01:34.260 Now is a strength --> 00:01:35.462 coach, we've got a real problem --> 00:01:36.129 here, right? --> 00:01:37.697 Because not only is my brother --> 00:01:39.466 at the upper limits of what a --> 00:01:40.300 of what he's --> 00:01:41.468 capable of doing --> 00:01:42.735 as a professional athlete, --> 00:01:44.337 as a as an athlete himself, --> 00:01:46.940 but he's at the absolute top --> 00:01:50.043 of what human beings are able to do. --> 00:01:52.479 So there's just not that much --> 00:01:53.713 further up to go. --> 00:01:54.881 I think at the time, --> 00:01:56.282 maybe the fastest pitch ever --> 00:01:58.785 was 103 or 105 miles an hour. --> 00:02:00.086 So he's at the absolute top. --> 00:02:00.820 And having spent some time --> 00:02:02.255 in the minor leagues and in baseball, --> 00:02:03.490 I understood that anybody who's throwing --> 00:02:05.024 even 97, is considered --> 00:02:07.060 an elite pitching prospect. --> 00:02:07.560 So for him --> 00:02:09.262 to want to go to 100, in my head --> 00:02:10.630 I was like, look, this is --> 00:02:11.764 I don't know that I said this out loud, --> 00:02:13.766 but it was a little unreasonable --> 00:02:14.634 of an ask. --> 00:02:15.535 But I said, listen, --> 00:02:16.569 let's challenge myself. --> 00:02:18.037 I was a pretty new strength coach. --> 00:02:18.838 Let's figure out --> 00:02:20.740 how we're going to make this happen. --> 00:02:22.509 So the first thing I did was I broke down --> 00:02:23.977 pitching mechanics, right? --> 00:02:25.078 So if you think about a pitcher, --> 00:02:25.478 my brother brother's --> 00:02:26.579 a right handed pitcher. --> 00:02:28.047 He steps back on the mound, --> 00:02:29.115 and then he's got to stand --> 00:02:31.284 tall on that right side. Right? --> 00:02:32.952 So this is right single leg --> 00:02:34.687 stance in terms of gait mechanics. --> 00:02:36.322 He's got to be really tall --> 00:02:38.424 and he's got to be really stable on right --> 00:02:39.359 single leg stance mechanics. --> 00:02:40.527 Now what you already know --> 00:02:41.794 as a strength coach, having watched --> 00:02:43.096 the previous video --> 00:02:44.330 is you now understand that --> 00:02:45.064 standing and right --> 00:02:46.699 stance is much easier --> 00:02:48.801 than standing in left stance. Right? --> 00:02:49.669 That's awesome. --> 00:02:50.637 That's an easy start. --> 00:02:51.838 But the challenge is --> 00:02:53.840 now he has to become elite --> 00:02:55.542 at going from right stance --> 00:02:57.877 into left stance. --> 00:02:58.178 Right. --> 00:02:59.245 And we know again, --> 00:03:01.247 from the anatomical asymmetries --> 00:03:02.248 that we now all understand --> 00:03:03.249 about the human body --> 00:03:04.117 is that the right stance --> 00:03:05.185 is easy to get into. --> 00:03:06.419 But the left stance is not. --> 00:03:07.554 And even want to try to get over there, --> 00:03:09.255 a lot of times that right side --> 00:03:11.157 doesn't want to turn off. --> 00:03:11.925 So if I'm looking --> 00:03:13.359 at the mechanics of the body, --> 00:03:14.627 the first thing I need to know, --> 00:03:15.295 because, look, --> 00:03:16.963 if we're going to get to 102, --> 00:03:18.965 we need everything working. --> 00:03:20.833 We need the whole kit and caboodle --> 00:03:23.403 we need. We can't have any restrictions. --> 00:03:25.171 We got to have the maximum power, --> 00:03:26.339 the maximum endurance, --> 00:03:27.974 the maximum flexibility, --> 00:03:29.309 the maximum mobility, --> 00:03:30.710 the maximum recovery. --> 00:03:32.579 We need to be absolutely elite --> 00:03:34.347 in every single category --> 00:03:36.249 if we're going to hit this limit, right? --> 00:03:37.750 So right stance. --> 00:03:39.052 He's got to be really good. --> 00:03:40.520 Now I've got to find a way --> 00:03:42.055 to make him very fluid --> 00:03:44.457 and remove any restrictions from him --> 00:03:46.025 getting over to the left side. --> 00:03:47.227 So we start assessing him. --> 00:03:48.361 We realize that his right --> 00:03:49.495 adductor is pulling it, --> 00:03:50.430 doesn't want to let go, --> 00:03:51.264 so his hips --> 00:03:52.966 aren't getting over in the frontal plane, --> 00:03:54.534 which from walking from gait --> 00:03:55.468 mechanics hits --> 00:03:56.669 right stance, hips --> 00:03:58.304 pointed over here in the frontal plane. --> 00:03:59.105 Then they got a shift. --> 00:04:00.607 The left adductors got to turn on --> 00:04:02.041 and pull my pelvis to the left --> 00:04:03.810 while the right side let's go. --> 00:04:04.410 If that right --> 00:04:05.778 abductor is not letting him go. --> 00:04:06.679 He's not going to be able --> 00:04:07.480 to go over there. --> 00:04:08.381 He's not going to reach --> 00:04:10.683 100, 101, 102, 103, whatever --> 00:04:12.252 it is, miles per hour --> 00:04:13.720 that he ultimately needs. --> 00:04:15.955 And we broke down his system --> 00:04:17.056 from all of those. --> 00:04:18.057 We're looking at the ligament, --> 00:04:18.758 this capsule. --> 00:04:21.094 Is he able to accept internal rotation --> 00:04:22.095 of that left femur? --> 00:04:23.229 Is his left abs --> 00:04:24.697 getting enough contraction? --> 00:04:25.732 Is his right abs, --> 00:04:27.900 or is his right rib cage expanding --> 00:04:29.068 while he's breathing --> 00:04:30.570 and so that the left ab --> 00:04:32.071 can stay on, right? --> 00:04:33.573 And here's what you've got to understand. --> 00:04:34.340 Right. You're listening. --> 00:04:35.642 You're listening to me talk. --> 00:04:36.876 You're hearing all these different --> 00:04:37.410 little things --> 00:04:39.646 about the pitching mechanics. --> 00:04:40.947 All we're doing --> 00:04:43.583 is breaking down gait mechanics. --> 00:04:44.417 This is the whole game. --> 00:04:45.718 This is what pitching is, --> 00:04:47.553 is a dynamic expression --> 00:04:48.655 of gait mechanics. --> 00:04:50.290 Gait mechanics, walking, --> 00:04:51.424 stand on my right side, --> 00:04:52.992 all of the muscles of right single leg --> 00:04:54.127 stance need to be on. --> 00:04:55.795 Then they need to transition off --> 00:04:57.764 as the muscles of left single --> 00:04:59.098 leg stance turn on --> 00:04:59.966 and they've got to be able --> 00:05:01.701 to seamlessly alternate --> 00:05:04.170 and reciprocate as I go from right stance --> 00:05:05.872 to left stance and back again --> 00:05:07.240 for as much as I need to. Right? --> 00:05:08.541 If we're a HYROX athlete, --> 00:05:10.777 we can see that pattern play out --> 00:05:12.412 through the course of --> 00:05:14.914 like 70% of the HYROX race. --> 00:05:16.182 Now in golf, --> 00:05:18.551 it's right stance to left stance, right --> 00:05:19.052 and running. --> 00:05:20.453 It's right stance to left --> 00:05:21.754 stance and pitching. --> 00:05:22.989 It's the same thing: --> 00:05:24.190 right stance to left stance. --> 00:05:25.658 So I've got to be able to understand --> 00:05:27.560 everything about gait mechanics, --> 00:05:29.128 all of the possible restrictions. --> 00:05:30.596 I've got to be able to measure it --> 00:05:31.564 and then I've got to be able --> 00:05:33.466 to remove any restrictions --> 00:05:35.234 from getting in and out of right --> 00:05:36.169 stance, getting in --> 00:05:37.370 and out of left stance. --> 00:05:37.603 That's --> 00:05:39.205 how we're going to make this perfect. --> 00:05:40.273 So the first phase --> 00:05:41.641 was restoring his body --> 00:05:42.542 to optimal movement, --> 00:05:44.477 getting out all of the restrictions. --> 00:05:46.913 The next phase is we had to implant, --> 00:05:47.847 we had to install, --> 00:05:51.651 we had to placed on top of perfect gait --> 00:05:52.752 mechanics, pace --> 00:05:55.755 on top of perfect gait mechanics, power, --> 00:05:56.989 and a little bit of endurance. --> 00:05:57.757 He didn't need a ton, --> 00:05:58.491 he was only going to pitch --> 00:06:01.427 for like 15 minutes at the absolute most. --> 00:06:03.496 So we needed to maximize his power --> 00:06:04.330 on top of that. --> 00:06:05.598 Now what we see a lot --> 00:06:07.233 and one of the most common phrases --> 00:06:08.301 in strength conditioning. --> 00:06:09.836 I remember hearing it early on a lot in --> 00:06:11.037 my career --> 00:06:12.772 was never put strength --> 00:06:13.873 on top of dysfunction. --> 00:06:15.975 We had to be incredibly smart about that. --> 00:06:17.043 We couldn't just, --> 00:06:17.877 you know, bench press --> 00:06:18.711 till the cows come home. --> 00:06:19.045 We couldn't --> 00:06:20.513 just squat all day long --> 00:06:22.315 because we would be getting stronger --> 00:06:23.149 in a vacuum, --> 00:06:24.250 but not with respect --> 00:06:26.386 to what we needed to be strong with. --> 00:06:27.820 I needed to be really strong here. --> 00:06:28.521 I needed my right --> 00:06:29.455 glute max to be able --> 00:06:30.623 to drive me off there --> 00:06:31.657 with a lot of power. --> 00:06:32.759 I needed my left adductor --> 00:06:34.727 to pull me over with a lot of power. --> 00:06:35.828 I needed this left hamstring --> 00:06:37.430 to pull this pelvis down --> 00:06:39.665 to stabilize me with a lot of power. --> 00:06:40.933 And I needed everything to work --> 00:06:42.635 perfectly in conjunction --> 00:06:44.003 with gait mechanics, --> 00:06:45.271 so that I was able to produce --> 00:06:47.840 flawless mechanics with as much power --> 00:06:49.842 as he possibly could produce. --> 00:06:51.477 So the first phase was restore --> 00:06:53.146 him back the proper gait mechanics. --> 00:06:55.615 The second phase was put as much power --> 00:06:56.883 on perfect gait --> 00:06:58.851 mechanics that we could possibly do, --> 00:07:00.086 and then we had to figure out a way --> 00:07:02.054 to make him a hyper athlete. --> 00:07:02.789 We had to figure out --> 00:07:05.258 how to make him a professional athlete. --> 00:07:07.260 How do you deal with the day --> 00:07:07.894 in and day out, --> 00:07:09.295 168 game --> 00:07:11.798 grind of a professional baseball season. --> 00:07:14.367 How for four for two months --> 00:07:15.334 going into spring training, --> 00:07:15.935 you're going to be working --> 00:07:17.069 every single day. --> 00:07:17.937 How do we deal with that? --> 00:07:18.805 How do we recover? --> 00:07:20.239 What's the nutrition again --> 00:07:22.708 to hit 100, 100 and 102. --> 00:07:25.044 We've got to do it perfectly. --> 00:07:25.711 Okay. --> 00:07:26.512 So at the end of this, --> 00:07:27.447 at the end of the season, --> 00:07:29.115 we put together a great piece of work. --> 00:07:30.883 I personally did not really believe --> 00:07:32.585 that we were going to get him to 100 --> 00:07:34.487 plus because of just how --> 00:07:35.488 how hard that was gonna be --> 00:07:36.756 and how few people --> 00:07:38.491 actually are able to get there. --> 00:07:39.959 But we go off to our separate ways --> 00:07:40.660 to spring training. --> 00:07:42.028 I fly out to Arizona, --> 00:07:43.496 he flies out to Florida, --> 00:07:44.931 and we just see what happens. --> 00:07:46.199 About two weeks --> 00:07:48.167 go by in spring training. --> 00:07:49.268 I got a text for my brother --> 00:07:50.136 and I looked down --> 00:07:52.371 and he says, I did it with a link. --> 00:07:53.406 I click on the link --> 00:07:54.607 and it comes up to a headline. --> 00:07:55.475 I think you can probably --> 00:07:56.409 still search it today. --> 00:07:57.043 It said Pat --> 00:08:00.213 Light hits 102 miles an hour in a game. --> 00:08:02.582 So we didn't only get 100, --> 00:08:04.116 we didn't get 101. --> 00:08:07.286 We got 102 miles an hour. --> 00:08:08.588 And I want you to understand --> 00:08:08.888 that, look, --> 00:08:10.356 my brother is uniquely talented. --> 00:08:11.324 He's got a great arm. --> 00:08:13.693 He's already throwing 97 miles an hour. --> 00:08:14.660 So I'm not taking credit --> 00:08:16.462 for his absolute cannon. --> 00:08:18.130 But what I am taking credit for --> 00:08:18.798 is me --> 00:08:21.868 turning him and turning him into a hyper --> 00:08:23.569 efficient athlete --> 00:08:25.238 in terms of gait mechanics --> 00:08:28.241 and then being very, very meticulous --> 00:08:31.577 about putting the right strength on him. --> 00:08:32.411 As a strength coach, --> 00:08:35.982 we can't just look at numbers on a --> 00:08:38.484 on a weightlifting program sheet. --> 00:08:39.352 We can't see --> 00:08:43.322 135 bench press turn into 185 and assume --> 00:08:44.590 that that individual --> 00:08:45.858 is going to be stronger --> 00:08:47.560 with respect to their sport. --> 00:08:48.394 We need to understand --> 00:08:49.595 the demands of the sport. --> 00:08:50.663 We need to understand --> 00:08:52.431 the demands on gait mechanics. --> 00:08:54.534 We need to understand where --> 00:08:56.035 within gate mechanics --> 00:08:58.204 that strength is most needed, --> 00:08:59.472 most applicable --> 00:09:01.240 and most desired --> 00:09:02.408 for the demand of that --> 00:09:03.776 particular athlete. --> 00:09:05.278 And when you really break it down --> 00:09:06.479 and we look at HYROX, --> 00:09:08.281 look how much you've got to run, right? --> 00:09:08.614 We're going, --> 00:09:09.382 we know we're going to want --> 00:09:11.684 a lot of strength and hip extension. --> 00:09:12.118 We're going to want --> 00:09:13.653 a lot of abs to hold us in. --> 00:09:14.954 We're going to need that at the rib --> 00:09:15.922 cage to expand. --> 00:09:17.189 We're going to need that hamstrings --> 00:09:17.623 to hold --> 00:09:19.225 us, into that, --> 00:09:20.359 you know, into the --> 00:09:21.928 in that sagittal plane. --> 00:09:22.228 You know, --> 00:09:23.796 you think about the lunge, right? --> 00:09:25.097 The sandbag lunge. --> 00:09:26.365 If I'm going to be stepping --> 00:09:28.000 back into a sandbag lunge, --> 00:09:29.869 I need to be in left or it's forward. --> 00:09:30.603 I'm sorry. --> 00:09:31.470 You're stepping into right --> 00:09:33.839 stance, left stance, right stance. --> 00:09:35.308 You've got to be equally --> 00:09:36.375 at all of those things. --> 00:09:37.443 And to really dominate --> 00:09:38.978 the HYROX circuit, --> 00:09:41.847 you've got to be perfectly functional --> 00:09:43.316 and perfectly strong --> 00:09:44.984 and particular to HYROX. --> 00:09:46.452 You have to have a tremendous amount --> 00:09:47.486 of endurance --> 00:09:48.721 on those gait mechanics --> 00:09:50.556 and on that strength to maintain it --> 00:09:51.958 throughout the entire race. --> 00:09:52.325 This is --> 00:09:55.394 what if this is this is elite athletics. --> 00:09:56.295 This is elite --> 00:09:58.164 biomechanics at the absolute --> 00:09:59.899 highest level of sport --> 00:10:02.902 in elite biomechanics, elite gait --> 00:10:05.905 mechanics is how the games are being won. --> 00:10:06.572 Okay. --> 00:10:07.106 And it's time for you --> 00:10:08.908 to take that understanding --> 00:10:10.176 and bring it to your training program. “With the 37th pick in 2012 Major League Baseball Draft, the Boston Red Sox select, Pat Light, from Monmouth University.” I was born and raised a Yankee fan. My Mom’s entire family is from New York City. We “hate” the Red Sox (and secretly, so did my brother). But in the blink of an eye, our pinstriped family instantly became part of Red Sox Nation! Baseball seasons became incredibly exciting. Each Spring, I would fly out to Arizona for Spring Training to start working for the Diamondbacks and my brother would fly down to Florida to start his season with the Red Sox. No matter what city we were in, I would always check my phone to see how he was doing. My brother was a big time prospect. Anyone picked in the first-round of the draft is treated like royalty in the minor leagues. He was talked about on all the shows and he was in all the magazines. The fans were excited to see what he could do once he got to Boston. In the offseason, my brother was the luckiest baseball player on the planet. He lived with me, an MLB Strength and Conditioning Coach, and each day, we would head to the gym to train together! In the beginning of the offseason, I asked him what his goals were for the next season so I could build our workouts around that. “I want to throw over 100 miles-per-hour!” he exclaimed, “I’m not talking about just 100, I want 101, 102!” I’m pretty sure I laughed out loud when he said that. He already threw about 98mph. He was already a flamethrower. I knew that to get someone from 98 to 101 is crazy hard. There are so few human beings capable of generating that level of power and when you already throw 98, you’re pretty much using everything you’ve got already. But I started to think about the system I had been secretly building to try and unleash every ounce of my own players’ athletic potential. I needed to put this system to the test. I started to think that maybe, just maybe, if I can press the right buttons, and put together a masterpiece of a workout plan, I might be able to make it happen. So, I decided to challenge myself and see what I could come up with. We called it “Operation genMAX.” Which was short for “Genetic Max” because our goal was to tap into every last drop of genetic, god-given power that he had…we knew we would need all of it. I threw the kitchen sink at him. We did all of my brain-training techniques to make sure his brain was allowing him complete access to his power and potential. (Stay tuned in to Level 2 of the HYROX365 Academy for more information on this). We trained super specific muscles to maximize his power and speed. And we focused in on only one energy-production system. The same one that Usain Bolt used to set the world-record in the 100-meter dash. For the entire offseason, we put in the work. He was fully committed to his goal and he trusted that I had the skills to help him get there. That spring, we both hopped on planes to go to Spring Training and we hoped for the best. Well, just a few weeks into Spring Training, I looked down at my phone and saw he had sent me a text. I picked up my phone, opened the message and it said… “You’re never going to believe what just happened. They clocked me today at 102 mph.” Even I was shocked! I knew my programs were good, but 102 mph seemed so unrealistic. Only a tiny few people in the world, who have genetically given superpowers, can throw that hard! It’s so rare that the media started to report about it and once it got onto Twitter, my players in Arizona started seeing the news too. The next day, players from throughout the organization were asking me to create their programs. Most of these guys had other Strength Coaches they worked with, but that didn’t matter, they wanted the fuel! They wanted the secret stuff, and they knew I had the secrets! But what I really had was a better understanding of gait mechanics. If you look at the way a baseball player throws a baseball, a right- handed pitcher will stand tall on their right foot, drive off of the mound and transition from standing on their right leg to standing on their left. This is gait. This is a dynamix expression of gait mechanics, as they need to be able to seamlessly transfer their weight and they need to do it while being explosive and under control. The most critical component of Operation genMAX was ensuring that I wasn’t compromising his already beautiful gait mechanics. Therefore, my mission was to make his gait mechanics more powerful. What is Gait? Gait = Walking; gait is just a fancy way of saying “walking”. Every system and function of the body operates through gait mechanics. Like I have written before, even the way your body wiggles food down your esophagus works through gait mechanics. It is the absolute top of the functional pyramid. When you hear someone talking about “functional fitness,” if they aren’t directly referring to gait mechanics, it simply isn’t functional. The entire body operates under the laws of gait. A Deeper Look at Gait Mechanics Let’s imagine someone walking through the park. Beneath the surface there is a symphony of muscle activity taking place. When the heel of the right foot strikes the ground, it sends the signal to the brain to turn on the muscles of right single leg stance. In right single leg stance the body weight is shifted off of the left and on to the right. To accomplish this, the muscles of right single leg stance must turn on and the muscles of left single leg stance must turn off. Once your body weight is over your right leg and you are squarely in right single leg stance, there’s no time to rest. Next, you’ll immediately begin to transition your weight over to your left side. Your left heel strikes the floor which, as you now know, signals the muscles of left single leg stance to turn on while simultaneously shutting off the muscles of right single leg stance. This is gait mechanics at a high level. Right Stance…Left Stance… Right Stance…Left Stance…Right Stance…Left Stance… This is how the body propels you forward. Dynamic Expression of Gait When we look at sports, like the example I gave above about a baseball pitcher, you can see gait mechanics come alive in a big, fun way. A pitcher standing tall on his right leg, pushing off of the mound and driving all of his weight and power to his left is a really powerful way of demonstrating gait mechanics. Most sports are exactly that. Baseball and Golf are really simple and obvious examples of this. If you think of a golfer, they take their club back and load their back leg before unleashing all their power as they transition from one stance-leg to the other. If I were to train a golfer, I would want them to be able to express as much power as possible within the confines of quality gait mechanics. When we break down a HYROX race, we see gait everywhere! Heck, 50% of the race is running! The Sled Push; the Sled Pull; Sandbag Lunges; Farmers Carries; Burpee Broad Jumps with the Step-Up- Technique. Damn near the whole race is a battle of your ability to maintain gait under duress. When I first started training for HYROX, my first mission was to build enough strength so that I could move the sleds. In my first week of training, I bench-pressed the 90lbs dumbbells. What did I do next? I immediately scrapped the program. “I’m strong enough”, I said to myself. I don’t need to spend another second getting stronger. I need to spend the rest of my prep time applying volume and endurance to my gait mechanics. To perform at the absolute highest level in a HYROX race, the muscles of gait must be capable of meeting the demands of HYROX otherwise the body will resort to less functional and less powerful compensatory muscles. Our mission then, is to train the gait mechanics of your athletes to last for the entire race. If you can do that, which you absolutely can, you will be pushing your athletes onto the podium. Chapter: The Big 3 - The Most Important Muscles to Train I’ve worked with 6-foot-9 NBA players who can jump 45 inches in the air. I’ve worked with Olympians who are quite literally the best in the world. But without a doubt, the best athletes I’ve ever worked with are professional baseball pitchers. More specifically, the ones who can throw absolute fireballs. I’m talking about the guys who are throwing 100mph+. These guys have everything working. They are perfect specimens. The beauty of working with a professional baseball team is that I got to see guys who were trying as hard as they could, but couldn’t throw any faster than 88 mph. Then I would work with guys who looked like they were barely trying and the ball would explode out of their hands and crash into the catcher’s mitt at 102 mph. What was the difference between these two types of pitchers? Glutes, Hamstrings, Adductors and Obliques! These are the prime movers of gait. The Prime Movers of Gait The muscles of gait are truly head-to-toe. Muscles as big as the glutes and hamstrings as well as tiny muscles like the lateral pterygoid in your jaw all have a role when it comes to gait and propelling the body forward. Most coaches will never need to know a damn thing about the lateral pterygoid. But EVERY coach needs to be incredibly proficient at training the prime movers of gait: The Glute Max The Hamstrings (all 3) The Adductor Magnus The Obliques (Transversus Abdominis and Internal Obliques) The reason we want to focus on these muscles is because they have all the leverage to move the skeleton. Take a look at the two images below. The first image is a picture of the rectus abdominis. This is a great example of what I’m talking about. Everyone wants the rectus abdominis. This is your six-pack muscle. But as you can see, it only has a few tiny attachment sites. When we compare it to the obliques, you can see the difference between the Rectus and the massive attachment sites of the abdominal obliques. The four prime movers of gait are the lowest hanging fruit. The ones that will give you the most bang for your buck. What did those flamethrowing pitchers have that everyone else didn’t? Big, juicy glutes, hamstrings, adductors and obliques. It was no coincidence that they could all easily dunk a basketball anytime they wanted. The Glute Max The primary role of the glute max in gait mechanics is to push you from one leg to the next. When I reach my left leg out in front of me while walking and being the weight transfer from my right leg to my left, the glute max is in charge of driving that transfer. The Hamstrings The primary role of the hamstrings in gait is hip extension. When your heel contacts the ground, it activates the hamstring which drives the heel back through the ground, thus propelling the body forward. The Adductor Magnus When your body weight shifts to the left during left single leg stance, it’s assisted by the adductor magnus (which is sometimes referred to as the fourth hamstring). Think about a supermodel walking down the runway. They usually have an exaggerated hip shift. Their hips pop from side to side. The adductor is the puppet master here. The Obliques The obliques are the glue that hold the upper body (ribs) and pelvis together. Like I mentioned above, the muscles of gait range from head to toe. The obliques serve as the first stop up the chain from the lower body. Building Training Programs 100% of the training programs I have built over the last decade have revolved around these muscles. Even when I work on conditioning, I am specifically trying to condition these muscles. It has become a right of passage for the clients I work with to have really sore hamstrings, glutes, adductors and abs after their first session. When they get together, I revel in the war stories they tell each other about them. These muscles are everywhere on my programs. Other muscles are mostly nowhere to be found. These are the muscles that really matter. When you build training programs, there is a lot of information you must weigh. There is no shortage of warm-up drills, exercises and modalities. There’s enough to make your training session last for 15 hours. Your job is to prioritize what’s most important and after a decade of experience working with the highest performers on the planet, I can say without a shadow of a doubt that your highest priorities should be getting these muscles working like absolute machines. Chapter: What it takes to manufacture an Elite Athlete --> 00:00:08.041 Okay. --> 00:00:10.810 The year was 2016. --> 00:00:12.746 I was in my first training camp --> 00:00:14.714 as a strength and conditioning coach --> 00:00:16.282 for the Los Angeles Lakers, --> 00:00:18.852 and we were at a beautiful resort --> 00:00:20.520 in Santa Barbara, California. --> 00:00:21.187 I'll never forget it. --> 00:00:22.689 We were on top of a roof --> 00:00:24.157 like restaurant thing, --> 00:00:25.792 and we were having our team brunch --> 00:00:26.860 before we were going to go off --> 00:00:28.294 to practice for the day, --> 00:00:29.262 and we were off in the corner --> 00:00:30.897 as us in the training staff. --> 00:00:31.798 Yeah, we were eating --> 00:00:33.033 and having a good time. --> 00:00:35.735 And over walks, our boss, --> 00:00:37.337 our general manager. --> 00:00:39.439 Now, previously in that summer, --> 00:00:41.408 or in July when the NBA draft happened, --> 00:00:42.308 we had drafted, --> 00:00:43.510 Brandon Ingram --> 00:00:44.811 with a number two overall --> 00:00:46.479 pick out of Duke University. --> 00:00:48.615 Now, the rhetoric on Brandon --> 00:00:49.716 coming out of college --> 00:00:50.717 was that he was too skinny. --> 00:00:51.885 Everybody was comparing him --> 00:00:53.086 to Kevin Durant. --> 00:00:54.220 And everybody was saying --> 00:00:55.088 like he's got to get bigger. --> 00:00:55.688 He's got to get bigger. --> 00:00:57.023 How is he going to handle the grown --> 00:00:58.224 man's game? --> 00:00:58.858 You know, the NBA --> 00:01:00.727 players are so big or so strong. --> 00:01:02.228 How is a skinny kid like this going --> 00:01:04.330 to hold up over the course of a season --> 00:01:05.799 nonetheless a career. --> 00:01:07.167 Now, one of the interesting things --> 00:01:08.635 about working for the Lakers --> 00:01:11.604 is that there is a ridiculous amount --> 00:01:14.274 of media scrutiny on the team --> 00:01:14.941 every single day. --> 00:01:16.509 If I turn on ESPN today, --> 00:01:17.644 there probably have --> 00:01:19.179 some segments on the Lakers, --> 00:01:20.680 whether there's a storyline or not, --> 00:01:21.915 they're just pulling them out of thin --> 00:01:23.149 air for that organization. --> 00:01:23.683 And I can --> 00:01:25.351 I can remember being in the weight room, --> 00:01:26.252 the team weight room --> 00:01:27.954 with the TV up, ESPN on, --> 00:01:28.588 and they're talking --> 00:01:29.756 about players on the Lakers, --> 00:01:31.758 and here are the players on the Lakers. --> 00:01:34.994 It's really interesting world to be --> 00:01:36.162 and especially as a strength coach, --> 00:01:37.497 because you can hear Stephen A. --> 00:01:38.998 Smith talking about this player --> 00:01:40.200 who's right here doing, --> 00:01:41.267 you know, a goblet squat --> 00:01:42.035 or something like that. --> 00:01:44.537 So the the pressure is high, right? --> 00:01:46.272 So everybody all the media, --> 00:01:47.273 they're asking questions. --> 00:01:48.208 Is he going to get stronger? --> 00:01:49.809 How much stronger can he get? --> 00:01:52.745 To add to add to the pressure, --> 00:01:55.014 out east back in Philadelphia --> 00:01:55.682 the number one --> 00:01:58.318 overall pick, Ben Simmons, --> 00:01:59.719 there was a report that had just come out --> 00:02:00.253 that he had gained --> 00:02:02.489 30 pounds of pure muscle, --> 00:02:04.591 in the off season. --> 00:02:06.459 So now the pressure is really on us --> 00:02:06.860 to do that. --> 00:02:08.595 And, look, our staff was awesome. --> 00:02:10.430 We had a great group of strength coaches. --> 00:02:10.964 We had a great group --> 00:02:11.831 of physical therapists, --> 00:02:12.632 athletic trainers, --> 00:02:13.833 some smart folks in there. --> 00:02:14.467 We knew that --> 00:02:16.736 there's just body types to this game. --> 00:02:17.971 Ben Simmons just didn't --> 00:02:19.439 have the same body type --> 00:02:21.207 as Brandon Ingram. --> 00:02:22.208 You know there's the ectomorph, --> 00:02:23.710 the mesomorph and the endomorph. --> 00:02:25.345 And you know, --> 00:02:27.514 Brandon fit in, he was a skinny guy. --> 00:02:28.548 We knew that. --> 00:02:28.982 Sure, --> 00:02:31.384 we could probably throw weight on him --> 00:02:32.318 and make him stronger --> 00:02:33.086 and make him bigger, --> 00:02:34.220 but is that necessarily --> 00:02:35.121 going to --> 00:02:36.689 make him a better basketball player? --> 00:02:37.657 So we as a staff --> 00:02:39.359 had to make an educated decision. --> 00:02:41.261 We had to read between the lines --> 00:02:42.028 and decide --> 00:02:42.896 what is it --> 00:02:45.131 that the organization really wants. --> 00:02:45.999 And what they want --> 00:02:48.101 is a great basketball player --> 00:02:50.503 that can play every single day, --> 00:02:51.471 be a very durable --> 00:02:52.539 hold up over a career, --> 00:02:54.674 have a really successful 10, 15, --> 00:02:55.975 maybe not 20 year career, --> 00:02:57.677 but maybe a 20 year career. --> 00:02:58.478 Like we want to be able --> 00:03:00.413 to create that for the organization --> 00:03:00.914 who are investing --> 00:03:02.415 millions of bucks into this guy, --> 00:03:03.750 and we've got to be able to deliver. --> 00:03:04.984 So the pressure was on. --> 00:03:06.553 So we're sitting at the table, --> 00:03:07.854 general manager walks over --> 00:03:09.389 and he starts asking such Quiznos, --> 00:03:10.423 what is you know, --> 00:03:12.025 how much weight can we put on him? --> 00:03:12.792 What's he doing? --> 00:03:14.260 This was really our first chance --> 00:03:15.495 of getting our hands on him. --> 00:03:16.729 Because after you get drafted, --> 00:03:17.497 it's a bit of a war. --> 00:03:18.565 When you get drafted in July, --> 00:03:20.099 you go to summer league in Vegas, --> 00:03:21.167 training camp was our first time --> 00:03:22.802 to really start working with him. --> 00:03:23.970 So he's asking us --> 00:03:25.071 how much weight can we get on? --> 00:03:26.039 Is eating it up? --> 00:03:27.207 Is he getting protein? --> 00:03:27.607 Is he --> 00:03:28.675 you know, what supplements --> 00:03:29.509 is he going to be doing --> 00:03:30.210 and stuff like that. --> 00:03:31.277 And we're, you know, going with it. --> 00:03:32.212 We're answering the questions. --> 00:03:33.580 We're trying to figure it out. --> 00:03:34.914 But we knew again, --> 00:03:35.348 we knew that --> 00:03:37.650 it would be unwise for us to, --> 00:03:38.985 just throw weight on him. --> 00:03:40.787 I’m sure as you probably know --> 00:03:42.222 that as well. --> 00:03:43.890 So, what we had to do --> 00:03:45.525 was we had to improve --> 00:03:48.061 Brandon Ingram as a basketball player. --> 00:03:48.528 Now, here's --> 00:03:50.730 the ultimate challenge at that level. --> 00:03:52.232 Much like my brother --> 00:03:54.033 Brandon Ingram was a specimen. --> 00:03:55.101 He's a freak athlete. --> 00:03:56.336 He's six foot nine, --> 00:03:59.205 seven foot four wingspan. --> 00:04:00.907 He runs like a deer. --> 00:04:03.376 He can jump 42in in the air. --> 00:04:04.978 And now for us, our job. --> 00:04:05.812 We are being paid --> 00:04:07.380 by one of the most prestigious sports --> 00:04:08.915 franchises in the world --> 00:04:09.682 to get this --> 00:04:12.852 freak athlete who jumps 42in in the air --> 00:04:15.154 to jump 43. --> 00:04:16.389 Now you know that --> 00:04:18.157 this requires perfection. --> 00:04:19.659 We have to move mountains. --> 00:04:20.827 The amount of effort --> 00:04:23.596 required for one inch in vertical leap --> 00:04:25.298 at that level is huge. --> 00:04:27.467 If he was jumping 24in in the air, --> 00:04:30.670 we could make great huge whopping changes --> 00:04:32.071 because he's pretty low. --> 00:04:33.473 But when you're at the absolute --> 00:04:36.276 outer limits of what a human being --> 00:04:38.111 is capable of doing, --> 00:04:41.014 there's just not that much further to go. --> 00:04:42.649 Now, one of the big challenges --> 00:04:44.517 of working in a professional sports --> 00:04:46.152 season, particularly baseball --> 00:04:46.753 and basketball, --> 00:04:48.488 but we'll talk about the NBA here, --> 00:04:50.323 is that there's 82 games in the season. --> 00:04:51.457 Now that's not counting --> 00:04:52.158 the Summer league. --> 00:04:53.760 That's not counting preseason. --> 00:04:55.194 That's not counting Olympics --> 00:04:56.062 which a lot of these guys --> 00:04:57.230 have obligations to. --> 00:04:58.531 This is not counting --> 00:04:59.732 what happens in the playoffs. --> 00:05:01.501 There's well over 100 games --> 00:05:03.670 for most of these guys in every season. --> 00:05:04.404 And what I found --> 00:05:05.305 to be pretty interesting, --> 00:05:06.139 and I didn't realize this --> 00:05:07.674 before I got into the NBA, --> 00:05:09.309 was that you are going --> 00:05:11.244 every single, every other night. --> 00:05:11.577 I'm sorry. --> 00:05:12.679 You're going every other night. --> 00:05:13.179 It's there's only --> 00:05:14.614 one day off in between games --> 00:05:17.183 and the amount of travel is mind numbing. --> 00:05:18.117 I always tell this story --> 00:05:20.653 about one road trip that we had --> 00:05:21.921 when I was working for the Lakers. --> 00:05:23.589 We practiced in LA. --> 00:05:24.290 After practice, --> 00:05:24.957 we went to the airport --> 00:05:25.958 and we flew to New Orleans. --> 00:05:26.726 The next night --> 00:05:28.328 we played the Pelicans in New Orleans. --> 00:05:29.529 After the game, we went to the airport. --> 00:05:30.630 We flew to Chicago. --> 00:05:31.931 The next night we were in Chicago. --> 00:05:34.267 We played the Bulls in Chicago. --> 00:05:35.268 After the game, we flew, --> 00:05:36.169 we got on a plane --> 00:05:37.904 and we flew to Toronto --> 00:05:39.172 Off-day in Toronto. --> 00:05:41.107 Then we played the Raptors --> 00:05:41.674 the next night. --> 00:05:42.608 After the game we went to --> 00:05:44.077 the airport, went through customs, --> 00:05:45.311 flew to Memphis, --> 00:05:46.579 Played the next night in Memphis, --> 00:05:47.580 got on a plane, --> 00:05:48.948 back to the airport, --> 00:05:50.850 got on a plane, flew back to LA. --> 00:05:52.418 So you're talking five cities, --> 00:05:55.088 three time zones. --> 00:05:56.522 I mean, I remember when I got to Memphis, --> 00:05:57.957 I didn't remember what hotel room --> 00:05:58.858 I was in anymore. --> 00:05:59.959 I just knew what floor I was on. --> 00:06:00.927 I was just going from door --> 00:06:02.762 to door to door, trying to see which --> 00:06:04.597 which one of the which lock --> 00:06:06.099 my key would let me into. --> 00:06:07.300 Yeah, because it was so crazy. --> 00:06:08.668 And I'm not even playing an NBA --> 00:06:09.769 basketball game, right? --> 00:06:10.870 So the amount of wear --> 00:06:12.939 and tear, the stress. --> 00:06:14.107 Yes, it's a private jet, --> 00:06:15.408 but a six hour flight is a six --> 00:06:16.075 hour flight. --> 00:06:17.009 Three different time zones --> 00:06:18.211 is three different time zones. Okay. --> 00:06:19.345 It's a little bit better. --> 00:06:20.213 The hotels are nicer, --> 00:06:21.147 the planes are better, --> 00:06:22.215 but there's still --> 00:06:23.716 a significant amount of stress. --> 00:06:25.118 And you're a seven foot guy --> 00:06:27.820 sitting at a tiny airplane seat. Okay? --> 00:06:29.889 So there's so much challenges to that. --> 00:06:31.324 So what we decided --> 00:06:32.525 that what we needed to do --> 00:06:34.660 was that it was probably not worth --> 00:06:35.795 all of the effort --> 00:06:38.264 to try to get him to improve marginally. --> 00:06:40.700 That we would be better served --> 00:06:44.270 training him is unlocking that last 10% --> 00:06:45.638 of athleticism, --> 00:06:46.973 of athletic performance, --> 00:06:49.976 and that comes down to recovery. --> 00:06:51.210 That comes down --> 00:06:52.979 to letting him be at --> 00:06:54.947 his best, at his 100% --> 00:06:58.351 further and longer than anybody else. --> 00:06:59.619 And in game number --> 00:07:00.720 one of the season - that year --> 00:07:01.387 we played the Houston --> 00:07:02.855 Rockets in the first game - --> 00:07:04.557 everybody starts at 100%. --> 00:07:06.192 And then everybody starts dipping down --> 00:07:06.859 as the games go --> 00:07:08.261 closer and closer to closer. --> 00:07:09.862 If I can take Brandon's curve --> 00:07:11.497 and every all of our other players curve --> 00:07:13.166 and make it less steep, --> 00:07:14.600 let it stay up to 100. --> 00:07:15.635 If I can maximize --> 00:07:17.069 his recovery on the off days, --> 00:07:18.604 if I can maximize his recovery --> 00:07:19.539 on the plane flight, --> 00:07:21.407 if I can use technology and science --> 00:07:22.909 and posture and movement --> 00:07:24.010 to figure out a way --> 00:07:25.711 to help him sleep better, --> 00:07:26.879 to recover more, --> 00:07:28.347 to improve himself in --> 00:07:29.882 between the sessions, --> 00:07:30.716 then I'm going to get --> 00:07:32.452 a performance adaptation, --> 00:07:34.053 a performance improvement, --> 00:07:36.522 because he's not dipping down too far --> 00:07:38.458 and dipping down faster than anybody else --> 00:07:39.859 so that a game 70, --> 00:07:42.728 72, 73, in the fourth quarter, --> 00:07:45.198 he's closer to 100% than anybody else --> 00:07:47.133 because his ability to recover is better. --> 00:07:49.969 And there's so many avenues of the body --> 00:07:51.037 that allow us to do that. --> 00:07:51.671 Did you know that --> 00:07:53.139 the aerobic energy system --> 00:07:54.874 is the only energy system --> 00:07:56.442 in charge of recovery? --> 00:07:57.310 So if I'm training him --> 00:07:59.111 for two anaerobically, --> 00:08:00.446 I'm going to be lessening --> 00:08:01.681 his ability to recover. --> 00:08:02.215 Do you know that --> 00:08:03.549 we could use binaural beats --> 00:08:05.284 to force his brain --> 00:08:08.287 to go into a recovery state brainwave, --> 00:08:10.690 to force him to recover further --> 00:08:11.724 on a plane ride --> 00:08:12.458 on a three hour --> 00:08:14.760 flight from Chicago to, to Toronto --> 00:08:16.395 to improve his ability to sleep, --> 00:08:18.498 to get more recovery out of him, --> 00:08:20.433 to allow him to do that. --> 00:08:24.303 Truly, anybody can make a newbie better --> 00:08:24.837 in the weight room. --> 00:08:25.905 I'm pretty sure that --> 00:08:27.240 if somebody has never worked out --> 00:08:28.808 before, my mom decided --> 00:08:30.309 to be their personal trainer, --> 00:08:31.844 I think she could get them --> 00:08:34.714 a 50%, 60% improvement --> 00:08:36.115 just by improving the volume. --> 00:08:37.483 Doing general progressive --> 00:08:38.684 overload, right? --> 00:08:40.786 Anybody can make somebody tired. --> 00:08:43.356 Anybody can make a newbie stronger. --> 00:08:45.591 But when you get up to that last, --> 00:08:47.193 you know that last frontier --> 00:08:48.494 that you've gotten them through, --> 00:08:50.196 they're 90% of the gains --> 00:08:50.630 that they're going --> 00:08:51.631 to acquire in their career. --> 00:08:52.398 When their training --> 00:08:56.569 age is already very high. --> 00:08:58.638 How do you get them to go even further? --> 00:09:01.107 How do you unlock that last 10%? --> 00:09:02.508 And that last 10% --> 00:09:03.876 is not doing the same stuff --> 00:09:05.044 that got you there. --> 00:09:06.245 It's doing different stuff. --> 00:09:07.213 It's recovering. --> 00:09:07.947 It's allowing you --> 00:09:10.149 to be yourself for longer. --> 00:09:12.018 And that was something that we, we, --> 00:09:13.052 we discovered --> 00:09:14.320 having working with Brandon Ingram --> 00:09:15.755 and trying to find a way --> 00:09:17.089 to still do our job, --> 00:09:18.291 to still make him a better --> 00:09:19.425 basketball player --> 00:09:21.093 while doing it efficiently, --> 00:09:22.461 getting the most bang for our buck --> 00:09:24.196 with our sessions in the weight room, --> 00:09:25.631 and doing everything we can to do that. --> 00:09:26.866 And Brandon has gone on --> 00:09:28.568 to have an incredible career as an NBA --> 00:09:29.569 all star. --> 00:09:30.536 And he's --> 00:09:31.470 I think he's with the Pelicans --> 00:09:32.638 now and doing awesome. --> 00:09:34.974 So, listen, --> 00:09:37.610 if you're trying to get that last 10%, --> 00:09:38.311 if you're hitting --> 00:09:39.946 those training plateaus, --> 00:09:40.980 we've got to look through --> 00:09:41.981 a different lens on --> 00:09:44.050 how we're going to improve yourself --> 00:09:45.618 or improve your athletes --> 00:09:47.386 in terms of their performance long term. We were sitting up on some rooftop restaurant at the Bacara Resort in Santa Barbara, California. This is where we, the Los Angeles Lakers, were staying during the 2016 Training Camp (which was being held at UC Santa Barbara). Our General Manager, Mitch Kupchak, walked over to our table where the training staff was eating to talk about our newest rookie, the 6-foot-9 standout from Duke University and #2 overall pick in the draft, Brandon Ingram. Brandon was skinny. Very skinny and the obvious concerns with him was whether he would be able to sustain the physicality of the NBA. A common comparison was Kevin Durant, but it’s hard to compare a first-year rookie, with a sure-fire hall of famer. Mitch wanted to talk about putting more muscle on the young rookie. Reports were swirling out of Philadelphia, where their skinny rookie, Ben Simmons, had apparently gained upwards of twenty pounds since being drafted. This put some added pressure onto our Strength and Conditioning Staff to perform. The problem was, we knew that wasn’t going to happen. We knew we couldn’t just throw 20 pounds on this frame. We knew he would likely be “skinny” his whole career (and his whole life for that matter). He just had that “ectomorph” body type, whereas Simmons had more of a mesomorph frame. Technically, we could get him to gain weight, but it would only slow him down and make him less athletic. We were faced with a judgment call. We knew what the organization REALLY wanted. They wanted a great and CONSISTENT basketball player, and we knew we could deliver that, just not the way they had in mind. The problem with any NBA player is that, not only are they pushing their own physical limitations as to how high they can jump and how fast they can run. But they are pushing the very limits of humans. Brandon is 6-foot-9, runs like a deer and jumps 40 inches in the air. To get him to jump 41 inches or run slightly faster, it takes a massive effort and significant appreciation to the details. When you read about all the benefits of exercising, you’re reading about exercise in general. For the average couch potato, yes, it is helpful for them to do literally anything fitness related: Zumba Pilates Yoga Going for a Walk Basic Weightlifting Bodyweight Squats But for elite athlete, Brandon Ingram, I don’t think he would get much out of that Zumba class. Congratulations! You’ve arrived! This is a big moment in your career! This is the moment that you cross the threshold from general fitness to elite performance. No longer will the basics suffice. You must now commit to knowing the ins and outs of the human body better than anyone else. This is what it takes to train the best."

Despite their similar appearances, these structures have distinct anatomical features and functions that contribute to the efficient functioning of the body. Hey, HYROX coaches. Let's talk about tendons, the unsung heroes of our muscular system. These tough fibrous tissues are like the body's bungee cords connecting our muscles to our bones. Picture tendons as super strong rubber bands made mostly of collagen fibers. These fibers are arranged in neat parallel bundles, kind of like a well organized cable system. This structure is what gives tendons their superpower, the ability to transmit force from muscles to bones with incredible efficiency. Now, why are tendons so crucial for our hierar athletes? Well, they are the key players in transforming muscle contractions into actual movement. Take the Achilles tendon, for example. It connects our calves to our heel bone, allowing us to push off the ground during those grueling runs and jumps in high rocks. But wait, there's more. Tenants aren't just passive connectors, they are also energy savers. During dynamic movements like the 1K runs in between the high rock stations with the right running technique, tenants can actually store and release energy. It's like having a built in spring system, helping our athletes to move more efficiently and conserve energy throughout the competition. By focusing on exercise that strengthen both muscles and their connecting tendons, we can help our athletes perform better and potentially reduce their risk of injury. Remember, in the world of hiros, every bit of efficiency counts. Now let's turn our attention to ligaments, the unsung heroes of our joints. These tough fibrous bands are like the security guards of our skeletal system, connecting bones to other bones and keeping everything in check. Picture ligaments as flexible yet strong ropes made mostly of collagen fibers. Unlike the neat parallel arrangement and tendons, ligament fibers are more freestyle in their layout. This unique structure is what gives the ligaments their superpower, the ability to provide stability in multiple directions. Now, why are ligaments so crucial for our hiar athletes? Well, they are the bodyguards of our joints, setting limits on how far they can move. Take the anterior cruciate ligament or ACL in the knee. It's like a bouncer preventing the tibia from sliding too far forward relative to the femur. But wait, there's more. ligaments aren't just passive restraints. They are equipped with tiny sensors called mechcono receptors. These little guys are constantly feeding information to our nervous system about the position and movement of our joints. It's like having a built in GPS for our body, helping us maintain balance and coordination throughout the hiros course. By respecting these crucial structures and working to strengthen the muscle around them, we can help our Hiro competitors perform at their peak while minimizing the risk of injury. Remember, in the world of HYROX, every little bit of stability counts. Chapter: Role of Tendons and Ligaments in Human Movement Both tendons and ligaments are integral to human movement and overall musculoskeletal health. Tendons ensure that the force generated by muscles is effectively transmitted to bones, enabling movement. Without tendons, muscles would not be able to produce the necessary leverage to move the skeletal system. Ligaments, by providing joint stability, ensure that movements are executed within a safe range, preventing injuries such as dislocations and sprains. In addition to their mechanical roles, tendons and ligaments also play a part in sensory feedback. The mechanoreceptors within these structures send information to the brain about joint position and movement, contributing to proprioception and the body's ability to perform complex, coordinated movements. In summary, tendons and ligaments are fundamental to the functionality and efficiency of the musculoskeletal system. Tendons connect muscles to bones, allowing for the transfer of force and facilitating movement, while ligaments connect bones to other bones, providing joint stability and preventing excessive movement. Together, these structures ensure that the body can perform a wide range of movements with precision and stability, highlighting their essential roles in human movement and biomechanics. Joints, cartilage, and tendons also play crucial roles in human movement. Joints are, as you have learned before, the points where two or more bones meet, allowing for movement and providing support. Cartilage cushions the joints and helps reduce friction, while tendons attach muscles to bones and transmit the force produced by the muscles."

Video 2 --> 00:00:09.919 Thank you, Ralf, for the introduction and a very warm --> 00:00:11.560 welcome to the second module of --> 00:00:13.199 the Hyrox Academy Level 1 course. --> 00:00:16.600 My name is Ralf Wentz, I'm head of Hyrox365 Performance, --> 00:00:19.559 and I'm thrilled to have you here as we embark on this --> 00:00:21.399 journey into the fascinating world of --> 00:00:22.960 functional anatomy and biomechanics. --> 00:00:27.000 The human body is an amazing creation, made up of various --> 00:00:28.960 interconnected systems that allow --> 00:00:31.480 us to move in so many ways every day. --> 00:00:35.000 In Hyrox competition, the impressive athletic abilities we --> 00:00:36.799 see are due to the combined work of --> 00:00:39.439 bones, muscles, tendons and fascia. --> 00:00:42.799 These parts work together so we can flex, extend and --> 00:00:45.359 rotate, creating the power needed for each movement. --> 00:00:48.840 In this module, we explore not just what these body parts --> 00:00:50.640 are, but how they work together. --> 00:00:53.799 Think of the body as a team where each muscle joint and --> 00:00:57.159 bone has its own job, but also helps the whole body to move --> 00:00:59.880 better, especially in sports and athletic activities. --> 00:01:03.280 As we navigate through this module, I encourage you to --> 00:01:04.840 immerse yourself fully, ask --> 00:01:06.640 questions and engage with the material. --> 00:01:10.079 This knowledge will empower you to design highly effective --> 00:01:13.640 training programs, optimize performance and enhance the --> 00:01:15.560 athletic capabilities of your trainees. --> 00:01:17.200 So let's get started. --> 00:01:20.400 Here's to a great learning experience and to becoming even --> 00:01:23.719 more skilled, insightful and impactful coaches. --> 00:01:25.120 Welcome aboard! In this module, we will explore Functional Anatomy, which is crucial for understanding how our bodies move and perform, especially in HYROX training and competition. We'll examine the structure and function of the human body and how they interact to create movement. This knowledge will help in designing effective training programs and improving performance. Anatomy studies the structure of living organisms, focusing on identifying and describing body parts, organs, and tissues. It provides a detailed understanding of the body's physical makeup, including bones, muscles, nerves, and blood vessels. Functional Anatomy goes further by examining how these structures work together to produce movement and perform functions. For example, while anatomy describes the position and appearance of a muscle, functional anatomy looks at how that muscle contributes to movement, interacts with other muscles and structures in the body, and adapts during physical activity. The main difference between Anatomy and Functional Anatomy is their focus: Anatomy emphasizes structure, while Functional Anatomy emphasizes the relationship between structure and function. In this module, alongside our exploration of Anatomy and Functional Anatomy, we will delve into the study of Biomechanics. Biomechanics focuses on the mechanical principles that govern human movement. Understanding Biomechanics is crucial for comprehensively analyzing how the body moves and performs, especially in the context of HYROX training and competition. By examining the mechanical aspects of muscles, bones, and joints, we can gain insights into optimizing performance and movement, preventing injuries, and designing effective training programs that align with the body's natural mechanics. For HYROX coaches, this knowledge is vital for developing strategies that enhance athletic performance and ensure the safety of their athletes. Multiple experts will be leading you through this important module: Sport scientist and movement specialist Ralph Wentz, who is also heading HYROX365 PERFORMANCE, has put together an extensive team of experts consisting of sports scientists, trainers, therapists and athletic coaches to convey the complex interrelationships of these topics.

Joints allow movement but not all joints are moveable. Exercise can help keep joints strong and healthy and knowing which muscles control which joints will make exercise prescription much easier. There are several different types of joints. Fibrous (immovable) joints – these represent some of the most rigid of the joints, such as the cranial joints. The cranial bones interlock with one another and are bound together with fibrous connective tissue. They possess high levels of stability but lack the ability for movement. Cartilaginous (slightly movable) joints – in these types of joint there is some limited potential for movement. Articulating bones are connected by fibrocartilage. Examples include, the pubis symphysis and between the vertebral bodies. In contrast to the fibrous joints described above, they provide moderate stability and some limited movement. Synovial (freely moveable) joints – these joints allow the large movements we associate with exercise and consequently they will be discussed in more detail. Synovial joints come in a variety of different configurations which allow different types of movement. They do, however, all share several characteristics. Chapter: The Anatomy of a Synovial Joint Unlike the other forms of joint, the synovial joint has no connective tissue joining the articulating surfaces. Instead, there is a joint space and the ends of the bones are covered with a form of cartilage (hyaline cartilage) which serves to reduce the friction between the moving surfaces and provide some shock absorption. Bony surfaces are held together by a fibrous articular joint capsule which is flexible enough to allow plenty of movement but tough enough to support the joint where necessary. Sections of the joint capsule may thicken and form ligaments which provide additional support to the joint. On the inner surface of the articular capsule is a synovial membrane which secretes a lubricant called synovial fluid. Synovial fluid has the consistency of uncooked egg white and is more viscous (thick) when the joint is inactive – fluidity and production of this lubricant increases as activity increases. Synovial fluid serves to help lubricate the joint surfaces and provides nutrients to the articular cartilage, which has a poor blood supply and is white in colour. Welcome back, everybody. Now, let's take a closer look into the fascinating world of synovial joints. These joints, though sharing fundamental features, exhibit a wide range of structures and movements. We can broadly categorize them into six main types, ball and socket, hinge, pivot, gliding, saddle, and ellipsoid joints. Let's start with the ball and socket joint. This type allows for movement in nearly any direction, making it incredibly versatile. You'll find these joints in the hips and shoulders. Moving on to the pivot joint, this joint type permits rotation around an axis. For instance, in your neck, the atlas and axis vertebra form a pivot joint, enabling head rotation. In the forearm, the radius and ulna create a pivot joint allowing for supination and pronation movements. Then there's the gliding joint where the articulating surfaces are typically flat, allowing for simple sliding movements. Ligaments limit these movements to forward, backward, and side to side. You'll find gliding joints in areas like between the patella and femur, the carpets and tarsals, and the acromium process and clavicle. Now let's talk about the saddle joint, which resembles one saddle sitting atop another. This joint allows for back and forth and up and down movements, but not rotation like a ball and socket joint. A prime example is the joint at the base of your thumb between the metacarpal and the trapezium. Finally, we have the ellipsoe joint, similar to the ball and socket joint, but more oval shaped. This structure limits movement to side to side and back and forth. You'll find ellipsoid joints in the wrists between the radius and carpals and between the metacarpals and phalanges. Understanding these joint types help us appreciate how our bodies move and adapt, supporting a wide range of activities from simple daily tasks to high performance sports."

This incredible structure is a cornerstone of our body's support system and plays a crucial role in movement. The vertebral column is not just a stack of bones, it's a marvel of engineering that provides central support for our body and facilitates a wide range of movements. In Hiros, this becomes particularly important. But that's not all. The vertebral column also serves as a protective housing for our spinal cord, which is vital for distributing nerves throughout the body. First, let's consider the structure. The spine consists of 33 individual vertebrae spread across 5 distinct sections cervical, thoracic, lumbar, sacrum and coccyx. Each section plays a unique role in our movement. Now let's break down the structure from top to bottom. First, we have the cervical region in the neck consisting of 7 vertebrae. Next is the thoracic or chest section, which has 12 vertebrae. Moving down, we reach the lumbar region in the lower back, made up of 5 vertebrae. Then we have the sacrum, which contains 5 fused vertebrae. And finally at the base of the spine, we find the coccyx or tailbone composed of 4 vertebrae. Interestingly, there's quite a bit of variation between individuals when it comes to the number of vertebrae. Some people may have extra vertebrae in certain regions and fewer in others. However, the cervical region tends to be the most consistent across individuals. Understanding the structure and function of the vertebral column and its crucial role in human movement is important for hierarchs. You may ask why that is. Well, think about the variety of movements in a hierar competition from the ski arc to the wall balls, each discipline requires a different engagement of the spine. For example, during the sled push, your spine needs to maintain a strong, stable position to transfer force effectively from your legs to the sled. On the other hand, during the burpee broad jumps, your spine needs to be mobile enough to allow for the quick transition between positions. But here's where it really gets interesting. The vertebral column doesn't work in isolation. It's part of a complex system involving muscle, tendons, and fascia. This system allows for the efficient transfer of force throughout your body, which is crucial in high intensity sport like Hros. We dive deeper into this part later in our module. Understanding this interplay can help you optimize your training programs and performance. For instance, by focusing on exercise that improves spinal stability and mobility, you can enhance your efficiency in movements like the farmer's carry or the wallboards. Please remember, a well functioning vertebral column is not just about preventing injuries, although that's certainly important. It's about allowing your body to move as a cohesive unit, maximizing your power output and endurance across all highro disciplines. So as you prepare for your next Harrock competition or training session, take a moment to appreciate the incredible role your spine is playing. By understanding and respecting its function, you can unlock new levels of performance and truly embody the spirit of functional fitness that Hro represents. Chapter: The Anatomy of a Vertebra and Vertebral Disc Before considering the different regions of the spine in more detail, it is important to examine an individual vertebra more closely. Whilst differing considerably between regions, the vertebrae share the same basic anatomical features. The diagram above shows a typical vertebra. To the anterior (the front) is the main vertebral body, which is a cylindrical bony disc. This provides the surface for the intervertebral discs to attach to and these form the main cartilaginous joints of the spine. To the posterior (the back) are a series of bony projections (processes) which interlink with adjacent vertebra to form synovial facet joints. A series of openings or foramen punctuate the vertebra. These allow nerves and blood vessels to pass though the vertebral column. The intervertebral discs are sandwiched between the bodies of neighboring vertebrae. They are composed of a fibrocartilage shell that surrounds a softer gel-like core. Their primary function is shock absorption however, they are vulnerable to injury if the spine is excessively loaded with poor alignment or if the back is held in a chronically poor posture (i.e. sitting at a desk with a rounded back). Chapter: Posture Deviation from optimal spinal posture can be common. Pregnancy can increase curvature of the lower spine to shift the centre of gravity backwards and compensate for the extra weight at the front. Postural abnormality can be present at birth or can occur at any stage of life and can be temporary or permanent. Long periods of sitting, for example, can increase the chances of developing hyper kyphosis – the rounding of the upper back. While it is important to be able to recognise these postural abnormalities and it may be necessary for a personal trainer to work around them; correcting such issues is the job of a physical therapist. Lordosis - the spine curves significantly inward at the lower back Kyphosis- characterised by an abnormally rounded upper back Scoliosis- a sideways curve which is often s- shaped or c-shaped Identifying optimum posture can be tricky as clothing and other parts of the anatomy may obscure the vertebral column. However, if a line can be dropped vertically from the ear through the middle of the shoulder and hip to a point just in front of the ankle, then posture is probably correct. Chapter: Anatomical and functional variations in the vertebral column Whilst it is noted above that the vertebra have the same basic features, there are considerable anatomical and functional variations between the different regions of the spine. These are summarized in the table below: Region No. of Key Features Cervical 7 the smallest of the vertebrae facilitates movement of the head contains larger and a greater number of openings (foramen) to accommodate nerves and blood vessels Thoracic 12 forms joints with the costal bones capable of relatively more rotation than the lumbar vertebrae Lumbar 5 the largest vertebrae, to support greater loads capable of relatively more flexion, extension and lateral flexion than the thoracic vertebrae Sacrum 5 forms a joint with the pelvis usually fully fused by the age of 30 years Coccyx 4 the lowest section of the vertebral column usually fused by the age of 30"

However, the driving force behind this is the muscular system. This section will explore and discuss the microscopic structure and main functions of muscles. Chapter: Types of Muscle Tissue The human bony contains over 600 muscles but muscle tissue makes up more than just your biceps and triceps. Muscle tissue is found in three distinct forms. 1.Smooth muscle Smooth muscle is the most widely distributed and it predominates in the internal tissues of the body, including the digestive, circulatory, urinary and reproductive systems. One of its major functions is to regulate the diameter of tubular structures, thus enabling the body to control blood flow and blood pressure, the passage of food down the digestive tract and even the amount of light entering the eye. Control of this form of muscle is involuntary and is exerted via the autonomic system. 2.Cardiac muscle (myocardium) Cardiac muscle is found only in the heart but, like smooth muscle, is also under involuntary control. The unique feature of cardiac muscle is that it possesses the capability of self-excitation. In other words, it will continue to contract even if completely separated from the rest of the body (for a short time at least). The autonomic system exerts some control over cardiac muscle by both increasing or decreasing heart rate and the strength of contractions. This is examined more closely in the cardiovascular chapter. 3.Skeletal muscle Skeletal muscles are attached from bone-to-bone across joints, and are the main focus of this chapter. Unlike cardiac and smooth muscle, skeletal muscle is predominantly under voluntary control via the somatic nervous system. Skeletal muscle has a number of functions such as: Producing movement Stabilizing body positions i.e. maintenance of posture Facilitating the circulation of blood and lymphatic fluid Generating heat Storage of energy substrates specifically glycogen Chapter: The Anatomy of Skeletal Muscle Hi, coaches, let's move on to the topic of skeletal muscle anatomy. Understanding this is crucial for grasping how our muscles generate force, which is fundamental to HYROX performance. Picture a skeletal muscle as a complex hierarchical structure. At its core, we have rod-like structures called muscle fibers running parallel along the muscle length. These fibers aren't isolated. They are organized into progressively larger bundles, each wrapped in protective membranes. Starting from the outside, we have the epimysium, that's AP meaning upon, which encases the entire muscle. Within this, we find bundles of muscle fibers called fasciles. Each fascile has its own sheet, the limesium peri meaning around. Going even deeper within each fussicle, individual muscle fibers are separated by yet another membrane, the endomesium endo meaning inside. Now here is where it gets interesting for us as hierarch coaches. This connective tissue isn't just for protection. It extends beyond the muscle fibers converging to form tendons. These strong strap-like structures are crucial. They are what attach our muscles to our bones, specifically to the periosteum, a tough fibrous layer coating the bones. Think about the Achilles tendon or the quadricep tendon. These are prime examples of the structure and action. Understanding this anatomy helps us appreciate how force is generated and transferred during hiros movements from the wall balls to the sled push. By grasping these fundaments so we can better optimize our training strategies and help our athletes perform at their peak. Remember, every rep in hiro is this incredible in anatomical system in action. By grasping these fundamentals, we can better optimize our training strategies and help our athletes perform at their peak. Remember, every rep in HYROX is this incredible anatomical system and action. Chapter: Force generation To explain how muscles generate force it is necessary to look even closer at the fine structure of muscle fibres. Below the endomysium are even smaller rows of fibres called myofibrils. Contained within these fibres are the structures which are responsible for force production – sarcomere. Myosin and actin and the sliding filament mechanism The ‘business end’ so to speak of force generation are two contractile proteins called myosin and actin, often referred to as thick and thin filaments respectively. These are arranged in a series of compartments called sarcomeres that run the length of the myofibril. Spiraling from the myosin filament is a series of ‘hook like’ projections referred to as myosin heads. During muscular contraction these heads attach themselves to the actin filament and rotate. The result of this is that the thinner actin filaments are drawn inwards dragging the ends of the sarcomeres together, this is referred to as the sliding filament mechanism. Myosin and ATP The power to drive the myosin head is provided by adenosine triphosphate (ATP – see energy systems section). The ATP molecule primes the myosin for activity by binding with the head. Energy from the ATP is almost immediately transferred to the head rather like a finger cocking a gun. When the conditions are right, the myosin head will then bind with the actin and rotate. Actin and Calcium Although the myosin head may have been primed with energy from the ATP, it will be unable to bind with the actin without the presence of calcium. In a relaxed state, the myosin binding sites on the actin are blocked by a combination of other molecules (troponin and tropomyosin), that must be moved before myosin can be attached. Surrounding the myofibrils is a network of tubes called the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) that act as calcium reservoirs. Stimulation of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (by an action potential) causes them to release their calcium into the fluid surrounding the myosin and actin (sarcoplasm). The calcium causes the blocking molecule to move away from the myosin binding site, thus allowing the ‘primed’ myosin head to bind with the actin and rotate. Without the influx of calcium into the muscle fiber, the sliding filament mechanism could not take place. The question arises therefore, as to what triggers the sarcoplasmic reticulum to flood the myofibril with calcium. To understand this process, it is necessary to take a look at the point at which nervous impulses reach the muscle. Action Potentials The stimulus for the release of calcium is the spread of electrical activity (the action potential) along the length of the muscles. In a resting state, muscle membranes have a negatively charged interior and a positively charged exterior. The difference between the two serves as a form of potential energy, rather like that stored in a battery. This is achieved through a combination of a selective permeability of the cell membrane and the presence of sodium pumps that actively remove positively charged sodium from the cell. The arrival of an action potential at the neuromuscular junction (where the nerve meets the muscle) causes the release of a neurotransmitter (acetylcholine), which in turn causes sodium to rush through the muscle membrane. As a result, there is a reversal of electrical activity (depolarisation), which if great enough, will cascade along the muscle fiber as an action potential, thereby triggering calcium release and beginning the sliding filament mechanism. Chapter: Types of Muscle Fibre There are three different types of skeletal muscle fibres. Each different type of fibre has different characteristics. While there is variation throughout your body, there is also variation from one person to the next. This helps explain why some people are naturally good at endurance activities like running while others are naturally strong and muscular. All types of fibre respond to exercise but ultimately, limits are set by genetics – a person with lots of type 1 fibres will never be as strong as someone with lots of type 2B fibres. This is an important consideration when setting goals or selecting activities for your clients. Muscle Fiber Types Comparison Type 1 Slow twitch / Slow oxidative Structure: • Red coloured • Smallest diameter • Large myoglobin content • Many mitochondria • Many capillaries Function: • Increased aerobic delivery • Produce less force • Resistant to fatigue • Slow contractions Activities: • Maintenance of posture • Endurance based activity Type 2A Fast twitch A / Fast oxidative Structure: • Red/pink colour • Larger diameter • Large myoglobin content • Many mitochondria • Many capillaries • Fast oxidative Function: • Requires aerobic delivery • Produce more force • Less resistant to fatigue • Fast contractions Activities: • Walking • Running • Sprinting Type 2B Fast twitch B / Fast glycolytic Structure: • White/pale • Largest diameter • Small myoglobin content • Fewer mitochondria • Fewer capillaries Function: • Anaerobic delivery • Produce most force • Least resistant to fatigue • Fastest contractions Activities: • Throwing • Jumping • Weight Lifting Muscle fibre type considerations Muscles contain a mix of muscle fiber types. The activities performed will determine the proportion of each fiber type. Muscles used to support the body, such as those in the back and head, contain more type 1 fibers. In contrast, muscles responsible for the force generated by the arms and shoulders contain more type 2 fibers. The muscles in the legs have a more even distribution of both fiber types since they need to generate movement and support the body's structure. Each person has a unique combination of fiber types, which affects their athletic abilities. This explains why some people excel at endurance activities while others excel at power disciplines. Appropriate training can develop both the size and capacity of muscle fiber types. It's possible to transform one fiber type into another with a shift in training. An increase in aerobic exercise will gradually change type 2B fibers into type 2A fibers, while an increase in resistance training will have the opposite effect. Hey there, HYROX coaches. Let's have a closer look at motor units and the all or nothing law. This concept is crucial for understanding how our muscles generate force during those intense hiro workouts. Picture a muscle as a team with motor units as the individual players. Each motor unit consists of a motor neuron. Think of it as the team captain, and the muscle fibers it controls, the team members. Now, here's where it gets interesting. These motor units follow the all or nothing law. What does that mean? Well, when a stimulus is strong enough, it triggers an action potential that spreads through the entire muscle fiber. It's like when the captain gives a command and the whole team responds. But if the stimulus isn't strong enough, nothing happens. No action, no contraction. It's all or nothing, folks. So how do we control muscle force in hierarchs? It's all about recruitment and frequency. We either recruit more motor units, imagine calling in more players from the bench, or we increase how often these units fire, like asking all players to move faster. The more units we recruit and the faster they fire, the more force we generate. It's that simple. Muscle proprioceptors The muscles have two small neural sensors that provide feedback and respond to changes within the muscle. The first is the muscle spindle, located deep within the muscle fibers. The spindle is a small sensory unit wrapped around individual muscle fibers like a coiled spring. When the muscle changes length, the 'coils' of the muscle spindle are either pulled apart or pushed together, depending on whether the muscle is lengthening or shortening. This change in muscle length and the resulting change in the muscle spindle stimulate neural firing to the central nervous system at the spinal level. A lengthened muscle and muscle spindle stimulate the muscle to contract. The degree of contraction depends on the extent and rate of muscle length change. Generally, the greater the range of motion and the faster the muscle lengthens, the stronger the contraction. This process is known as the stretch reflex. The second proprioceptor, the Golgi Tendon Organ (GTO), is located in the tendon. The tendon is inelastic, so the GTO cannot detect changes in muscle length. However, when a muscle contracts, it pulls on the tendon, creating tension. The GTO measures the amount of tension and, when activated, sends a signal to the spine, causing an inhibitory effect on the same muscle. This relaxation response, due to GTO activation, is called the inverse stretch reflex. Muscle spindles are continually activated during movement as muscles change lengths with the motions performed. This provides constant information to the CNS about muscle length and body part positioning. The spindles also induce muscular contractions aiding the movements. The GTO responds after muscular contraction by inhibiting it to allow the opposite action. Thus, muscle spindles and GTOs act as on and off switches for muscle activity during exercise and movement. It's important to opposing muscles need to be switched off to allow that movement. This inhibition of opposing muscles is called Reciprocal Inhibition (RI). RI is essential for normal movement but can also contribute to muscular imbalance. A very tight muscle group can send a continuous RI signal to the opposing muscle, inhibiting its function. Exercise and training have been shown to enhance the neural side of the muscular response, improving the stretch reflex and the inverse stretch reflex. Training methods like plyometrics are designed to develop the stretch-shortening cycle effectively. This training helps muscles develop more force, and it also improves timing and coordination of movement as the muscle spindles in supporting muscle tissue respond better. Effects of exercise on muscle tissue type Exercise generally has a positive impact on muscle tissue development, but different activities influence muscle fiber types differently. Muscles have three main categories of muscle tissue: Type 1 (slow twitch), Type 2a, and Type 2b (fast twitch). Science continues to expand this knowledge, identifying other muscle tissue types based on function and response. Type 1 muscle fibers are the most aerobic, with greater blood supply and more mitochondria. They respond well to aerobic, low to moderate intensity training. Type 2b muscle fibers are very anaerobic, with reduced blood supply compared to Type 1 and fewer mitochondria. They respond well to high-intensity exercise with higher force and power outputs. Type 2a fibers have characteristics of other fast-twitch fibers but can also adapt and take on some properties of Type 1 fibers. They respond to varying levels of exercise intensity based on the applied stimulus. Muscle fatigue, soreness, and oxygen debt Muscular fatigue, a decline in the muscle's ability to produce force, is something everyone experiences. There are many stages to a muscular contraction, so the causes of muscle fatigue can vary. Fatigue may result from an interruption of any events between the CNS and the muscle fiber. Diminishing levels of neurotransmitters in the nervous system may reduce the number of action potentials reaching the muscle fibers. Complex neural interactions related to pain and discomfort perceptions may also diminish performance. Within the muscle fibers, fatigue can arise from several sources. Depletion of glycogen stores limits the rate of ATP synthesis, while insufficient oxygen leads to internal chemical changes that directly interrupt the sliding filament mechanism. The cause of fatigue depends on the mode of exercise and will be discussed in the energy systems section. Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness (DOMS) Unlike the pain or discomfort felt during exercise, delayed-onset muscle soreness (DOMS) typically occurs 24–72 hours after a heavy exercise session. The precise mechanisms behind DOMS are still poorly understood. Some suggest the soreness relates to structural damage, while others believe it is an inflammatory response. Although the processes behind DOMS remain unclear, the causes seem to be universally agreed upon. DOMS is associated with intense eccentric muscular activity, and research also suggests that unfamiliarity with an exercise may contribute to DOMS. To minimize DOMS, there are several potential solutions. The first involves reducing eccentric muscle activity during the early stages of training, though this may be difficult to implement, especially in a sport like HYROX. The second involves starting a progressive training program at a very low intensity and gradually introducing overload. This is likely the best approach for a new client. The final approach, not for the faint-hearted, involves beginning training at a high intensity. Although DOMS will initially be high, subsequent exercise will produce less muscle soreness. Chapter: Types of Muscle Contraction Consider the bicep curl or squat and the muscles involved in these movements. Are the muscles used to lift the weight the same as those used to lower it? The answer should be ‘yes.’ However, the muscle activities are fundamentally different. When lifting the weight, the muscle shortens, and when lowering the weight, the muscle lengthens. If you pause midway, the muscle remains the same length. Throughout all these actions, the muscle is working. To distinguish between different types of muscular activity, several terms are used: Isotonic – describes muscle actions involving movement, i.e., concentric and eccentric Concentric – muscle generates force while shortening Eccentric – muscle generates force while lengthening Isometric – muscle generates force and remains the same length Isokinetic – muscle actions involving movement at a constant speed During the lifting phase of a bicep curl, the bicep brachii works concentrically. If the weight is held still at any point, this represents an isometric action. Finally, as the weight is lowered in a controlled manner, the biceps lengthen and work eccentrically. Chapter: Role of Muscle Efficient human movement relies on the coordinated activity of muscle groups, involving various combinations of different muscle actions. To understand the different roles muscles play during movement, they can be categorized as follows: Agonist/prime mover: The muscle(s) responsible for the desired action. For example, the bicep brachii during a bicep curl or the quadriceps during a leg extension. Antagonist: The opposing muscle(s) to the agonist. For instance, the triceps during a bicep curl or the hamstrings during a leg extension. Synergist: The muscle(s) that assist or modify the movement of the prime mover. For example, during hip extension, the hamstrings act as synergists for the gluteus maximus. Fixator: The muscle(s) that stabilize the part of the body that remains fixed. For instance, the shoulder girdle muscles stabilize the scapula to allow efficient movement of the shoulder joint. All right, HYROX coaches, let's wrap our heads around the next concept, muscles working in pairs. Picture this, muscles are like tag team partners positioned on opposite sides of our joints. They have opposite roles, but they work together seamlessly. Take the biceps and the triceps, for example. When you're doing those grueling wall balls, your bicep flex the elbow joint while the triceps extends it. It's a beautiful dance of contraction and relaxation known as the reciprocal inhibition. Now, here's a mind bender for you. Muscles can only pull, they can't push. Even when your athletes are grinding through push-ups or squats, what's really happening is muscles are pulling joints into extended positions or resisting gravity to control joint flexion. Every single movement in hierarchs from the sled push to the wall balls is the result of muscles pulling across joints. Understanding this concept helps you visualize the muscular action behind each hirox movement, allowing you to fine-tune your athlete's form and potentially prevent injuries. Remember, in the world of hiros and any other competitive sport, it's all about the pull. Muscle and Movement In this section, we'll present graphics showing which muscles are involved in various movements. This visual approach aims to provide a straightforward introduction to basic anatomy without too much detail. By focusing on visuals, we want to make the information accessible and easy to understand without detailed explanations. These graphics will highlight the key muscle groups activated during basic movements of different body parts, giving you a clear overview of how muscles work together. We will only show the skeleton without all the muscles, as we want to emphasize the result in movement rather than the muscles and their positioning in the body. However, for those coaches interested in a more detailed study, we will supply a list of further readings at the end of the functional anatomy module. This list will include books on anatomy where all the muscles and their positioning in the body are explained in detail. As we always say: there is no limit to what you can learn to become the best version of yourself as a HYROX coach."

The term “neuromuscular” specifically refers to how our nervous system (brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nerves and receptors) controls muscle contraction and relaxation. Our muscles operate based on signals from our brain; they follow the brain's commands. This muscle function determines how our joints move both individually and in coordinated patterns to produce movement. Even though muscle function and movement are ultimately determined by the nervous system, it's still important to understand the components of the human body and how they work together biomechanically. The main issue with understanding biomechanics and functional anatomy is that we've often left out the “bio” part, focusing too much on the “mechanical.” The following chapters offer you a sneak peek into some of the most exciting “bio” mechanical and functional anatomical concepts in performance and movement science. Feel free to explore each one to see which sparks your curiosity. As we move forward, remember that we'll just be giving a brief overview of 4 concepts related to the human body in movement and performance. These topics are quite intricate and will be explored more deeply in Level 2 of the HYROX Academy \"Mastering Performance\" Course. For now, we’re here to give you a taste of what these concepts are all about. When we advance to Level 2 in 2025, we’ll continue to dive into these ideas and develop a training approach that suits all HYROX Coaches worldwide as they guide their athletes to new height in performance. Chapter: The Joint-by-Joint Approach The “Joint-by-Joint Approach” is a concept developed physical therapist Gray Cook and strength coach Michael Boyle that suggests a pattern of alternating needs for mobility and stability in the human body's joints. According to this approach, some joints in the body are naturally prone to stiffness and need to be mobilized, while others are predisposed to instability and need to be stabilized. For instance, the ankle requires mobility, the knee requires stability, the hip requires mobility, and so on. Understanding and applying this approach can help in injury prevention and enhancing physical performance. Boyle and Cook's “Joint-by-Joint Approach” recognizes that each joint, or series of joints, in the body has a specific role or function and, based on its design and placement, has a particular inclination towards either mobility or stability. It's important to note that all joints need a combination of both stability and mobility to function optimally, but according to this theory, there is a dominant need for one over the other in each joint or set of joints Starting from the feet and moving upwards, the approach assigns the need as follows: 1 The ankle is a mobile joint, requiring sufficient range of motion, particularly in dorsiflexion. 2 The knee is primarily a stable joint, functioning best when it can maintain its alignment and control movement between the mobile ankle and hip. 3 The hip, with its ball and socket design, is a mobile joint, demanding good range of motion in multiple planes. 4 The lower back or lumbar spine is a stable area, where excess motion can lead to pathology. 5 The thoracic spine or mid-back requires mobility, particularly rotation and extension. 6 The scapulothoracic joint (shoulder blade area) needs stability to function as a solid base for the arm. 7 The glenohumeral joint (shoulder joint) requires a high degree of mobility to allow the wide range of arm movements. 8 The elbow, like the knee, functions best as a stable hinge joint. 9 The wrist and hand, like the ankle and foot, require mobility for various grasping and manipulating activities. By understanding these alternating needs, trainers, therapists, and individuals can better tailor training and rehabilitation programs to address the specific mobility or stability requirements of each joint. This could lead to improved performance, injury prevention, and more efficient movement patterns. Boyle and Cook's findings highlight the importance of the interplay between stability and mobility. They argue that problems often arise when the body is forced to compensate for a lack of mobility or stability in one area by overloading another area, which is not designed to handle this additional stress. For example, a lack of mobility in the ankle can lead to the knee (a joint that requires stability) becoming more mobile to compensate. This inappropriate mobility increases the risk of injury to the knee. The “Joint-by-Joint Approach” also underscores the importance of exercising in a manner that respects the natural function of every joint. This involves developing stabilization strategies for unstable joints and mobility strategies for immobile or stiff joints. Such tailored approaches can help improve movement efficiency, enhance athletic performance, and prevent injuries. In summary, the “Joint-by-Joint Approach” by Boyle and Cook provides a blueprint for understanding the body's alternating needs for stability and mobility. By implementing this approach in training and rehabilitation programs, one can ensure a balanced development of the body's joint system, thus optimizing potential for physical performance and minimizing risk of injury. Chapter: The Fascial-Slings Approach The “Fascial-Slings Approach”, popularized by Thomas Myers in his book \"Anatomy Trains\", provides a revolutionary perspective on the interconnectedness of the human body. This approach is rooted in the understanding that the body's fascia, a type of connective tissue, is not just a passive structure but an active and dynamic entity that influences movement, stability, and function. Fascia is a network of connective tissue that envelops and penetrates every muscle, bone, nerve, and organ in the body. Its composition and structure allow it to distribute force and maintain structural integrity. According to Myers, this fascia is organized into 'slings' or 'chains' that connect different parts of the body, allowing for integrated movement and force transmission. One of the key principles of the “Fascial-Slings Approach” is the concept of 'tensegrity', a term coined by architect and engineer Buckminster Fuller. Tensegrity refers to a type of structural organization in which tensional and compressional forces are balanced to maintain the integrity of a structure. In the context of the human body, it means that tension in one part of the fascial network can affect other parts, resulting in a chain reaction of movement and force distribution. The “Fascial-Slings Approach” identifies several key fascial chains, each with a specific function and composition. In the following, we will briefly describe only the four largest and most important ones in order to give you an idea of the importance of the different fascial slings for human movement. For instance, one of the key fascial slings, known as the Superficial Back Line, has a vast range of extension. It begins from the plantar surface of the feet, continues up along the posterior aspect of the legs, traverses over the sacrum, a crucial element of the pelvic region, proceeds along the entire length of the spine which is the body's central support structure, and finally reaches up to the apex, the top of the head. This fascial sling plays a significant role in maintaining our postural control, a fundamental aspect of our daily movements and balance. It is also heavily involved in the extension of the body, a movement paramount in many physical activities. Beyond these, the Superficial Back Line is also engaged in various dynamic movements such as jumping and running, making it essential for athletic performance. Another significant fascial chain that warrants our attention is the Superficial Front Line. This remarkable biological mechanism begins its journey from the top of our feet, making its way upwards along the anterior aspect of the legs. It continues its course over the curve of the rib cage, an essential protective structure for our vital organs. Its path doesn't stop there as it extends all the way up to the forehead, a significant area of the human face. This fascial sling plays an incredibly crucial role in our daily movements, particularly in flexion movements which are fundamental to many of our routine activities. Moreover, it holds paramount importance in maintaining postural control, an essential aspect of our biomechanics, when we are standing and walking. Understanding the role of the Superficial Front Line can provide us with valuable insights into the interconnectedness of our body and how to optimize its function. The Lateral Line, a crucial and fascinating fascial sling, originates from the outer aspect of the foot. It then extends upwards along the side of the leg, seamlessly crossing the hip and the trunk region. The path of this unique sling doesn't stop there, as it continues to ascend to the side of the neck and reaches up to the skull. This sling serves a pivotal role in the execution of lateral movements and stabilization, providing critical support to our body. It enables us to perform a variety of actions, ranging from our daily routine of walking, the more strenuous activity of running, and even the subtle art of maneuvering turns. This structure, therefore, plays a prime role in our locomotion, adding to the marvel that is the human body. The Spiral Line, which is a more complex and intricate fascial sling, elegantly wraps around the body in a helix or spiral-like fashion. It creates a connection that spans from each foot to the opposite side of the skull, crossing multiple parts of the body in its path. This particular sling plays a crucial role in rotational movements, allowing the body to turn and twist in a smooth and coordinated manner. Furthermore, the Spiral Line is instrumental in the distribution of forces during various forms of movement, whether they be simple or complex. By evenly distributing these forces, it aids in maintaining balance and providing stability during movement. This, in turn, contributes to the overall efficiency and grace of our motions. By understanding these fascial slings, therapists and movement experts can analyze movement patterns in a more holistic way. Rather than viewing the body as a collection of individual parts, the Fascial Slings Approach emphasizes the interconnectedness and interdependence of these parts. This understanding can guide the design of more effective training programs, rehabilitation interventions, and movement strategies. Moreover, this approach reinforces the importance of treating the body as a whole. It emphasizes that an issue in one part of the body can affect the function of other parts. This understanding can lead to more successful interventions, as therapists and trainers can address the root causes of movement dysfunction rather than just treating symptoms. In conclusion, the Fascial Slings Approach, as proposed by Thomas Myers, offers a transformative perspective on human movement and function. By acknowledging the interconnectedness of the body's fascial network, this approach provides valuable insights for optimizing movement, enhancing performance, and addressing movement-related dysfunctions. Chapter: Kinetic Chains Another way to categorize and understand the body’s movement is by using kinetic chains and subsystems. The most comprehensive and useful system for this is the \"5 Primary Kinetic Chains\" (5PKC) taught by Joseph Schwartz in his \"Dynamic Neuromuscular Assessment\" course. While there are many ways to organize the body biomechanically, the 5 primary kinetic chains are more specific to how humans are biologically designed to move. Each chain is important on its own, but understanding how they interact and support each other is crucial. These 5 primary kinetic chains are the building blocks for assessing and optimizing functional movement. Schwartz identifies five kinetic chains in the body - the Intrinsic, the Deep Longitudinal, the Lateral, the Posterior Spiral, and the Anterior Spiral. These chains correspond to different movement patterns and muscular engagements in our bodies. Recognizing and strengthening these kinetic chains can enhance overall performance and reduce injury risk by ensuring balanced and integrated movement patterns. The theorem of the 5PKC outlines a primary biomechanical and biological principle of movement: Bones, joints, ligaments, tendons, muscles and fascia do not work in isolation. They work together synergistically to create movement. When movement is balanced and efficient, all participants work together as a team. The 5PKC are not only the basis for gait, as illustrated on the following pages, but for all human movement. However, different movements have different relationships to gravity and the environment, and they utilize different muscle activations. These activations are referred to as kinetic chains, force transmission systems and sling systems. When we show up to the present moment with all of our senses, we invite the world to fill us with joy. The pains of the past are behind us. The future has yet to unfold. But the now is full of beauty simply waiting for our attention. The Five Primary Kinetic Chains: 1.Intrinsic - Respiration The intrinsic system includes the muscles of the inner core and respiration. Breathing and trunk stability are the basis of every movement. It is therefore about the relationship between the nervous system and breathing. Our respiratory system, the mechanism of the pressure systems, has a direct influence on the autonomic nervous system. \"You cannot control your movement unless you control your breathing.\" This is about mastering our breath in relation to our movement. 2.Deep Longitudinal Kinetic Chain - Shock Absorption The deep longitudinal kinetic chain includes the lower leg muscles, the hamstrings, the sacrum and the spinal erectors. The purpose of this chain is to disperse ground reaction force and absorb shock. It begins to create axial stability so that the larger, stronger muscles can generate force. So, it's about shock absorption as the ability to allow kinetic energy to move through the body joint by joint. If the wave cannot move freely through the fascial system, this energy must be absorbed in some way (e.g. through compensation). Imagine ocean waves breaking on the beach. The forces flow rhythmically and are absorbed by the sand. If there is a rock on the beach, the wave breaks there, and a turbulent exchange of energy takes place. 3. Lateral Kinetic Chain - Stability The lateral system comprises the lower leg muscles, adductors, abductors and the QLs and has the primary task of creating a basis for the work of our spiral kinetic chains. The stability of the pelvis and rib cage is of crucial importance here. The lateral system thus ensures the stability of the midline of the structure. The axis of the spine (axial skeleton) needs dynamic stability so that the appendicular skeleton has a platform on which to generate energy. Without the stability of the axis, the arms and legs are unable to generate power or perform work. 4.Posterior Spiral Kinetic Chain - Stored Elastic Energy The posterior spiral includes the toe and plantar flexor groups, the ITB, the gluteal muscles, the SI joint, the TL fascia, the contralateral lats and the extensor muscles of the shoulder and arm. Its main purpose is to store and release elastic energy through rotation. The fascia matrix is therefore our potential energy system. Efficient movements use the activation of the muscles to act on the fascial system. The fascial system distributes the load over as large an area as possible, which increases efficiency. As energy accumulates in the tissues, the potential release of this energy supports work production in the complementary movement. 5.Anterior Spiral Kinetic Chain - Transfer of Elastic Energy The anterior spiral includes dorsiflexors, biceps femoris, hip flexors, adductors, abdominals, pectorals, and shoulder and elbow flexors. The main purpose of the anterior spiral kinetic chain is to release much of the elastic energy stored by the posterior chain in complementary movement, and elastic energy can be released in different ways throughout the structure. In graceful athletes who move deeply, we see how elastic energy is efficiently stored and released. The energy is distributed throughout the fascial tissue and the result is seemingly effortless movement. Breathing, shock absorption, axial stability, stored elastic energy and the conversion of elastic energy are always present in the integrated movement. Summary The 5PKC form an integrated system. Understanding that each chain builds upon the last, has a distinct function, and plays a role in nearly all movements, allows us to use them as a training guide. If the core isn't functioning well, that's our starting point. If there's a lack of shock absorption, we focus on that. We then assess the axial skeleton's stability under demands. From there, we work on building strength and rotational power. The concept of the five kinetic chains also suggests the importance of training across all three planes of human movement during sport-specific training. This approach challenges and enhances the synergistic interaction of the kinetic chains, thereby improving human performance."

    "content": "Titel: Level 1 - Module 2 - Fascia & Myofascia URL: https://web.lemon-mobile-learning.com/hyrox/#/inhalt/18112 Chapter: Fascia Fascia is a band or sheet of connective tissue, primarily collagen, beneath the skin that attaches, stabilizes, encloses, and separates muscles and other internal organs. It plays a vital role in maintaining the structural integrity of the body, providing support and protection to the internal structures. All right, HYROX coaches, let's dive into the exciting world of fascia, the real hero of our body's architecture. Imagine a three dimensional spider web, intricate and interconnected, wrapping around every muscle, bone, organ in your body. That's fascia. This isn't just some passive packing material. No, fascia is a dynamic living tissue that's crucial for everything we do in HYROX. It's like the body's own high-tech compression we providing support, stability, and even force transmission throughout our entire system. Now, here's the interesting part, fascia comes in layers. The superficial layer just under your skin is like a flexible body suit. It's stretchy and adaptable. Then we got the deep fascia. This is the heavy duty stuff. It surrounds your muscles, tendons and organs, giving them structure and support. But wait, there's more. Fascia is loaded with sensory receptors, way more than your muscles, in fact. It's like having millions of tiny motion sensors throughout your body, constantly feeding information to your brain about position, movement, and tension. That makes fascia crucial for proper reception. Your body's ability to sense its position in space, essential for nailing those warblets and keeping proper form during the ski, right? And get this, fascia also acts like a superhighway for our lymphatic system, helping to flush out toxins and reduce inflammation. This could be a game changer for recovery between training sessions. Here's the kicker. For years, scientists and doctors pretty much ignored fascia. They thought it was just the bodies packing peanuts, but recent research has shown just how wrong they were. We are now realizing that healthy, well hydrated fascia could be the secret sauce for better performance and reduced injury risk in HYROX. So next time you're coaching your athletes through their HYROX training, remember, you're not just working muscles and bones. You're training in an intricate interconnected fascial web. By understanding and respecting this amazing tissue, you can help your athletes reach new levels of performance. Now that's something to get truly excited about in the world of HYROX training. Chapter: Myofascia Myofascia, specifically, refers to the fascia that surrounds and separates muscle tissue (hence the 'myo', which is derived from the Greek word 'myos', meaning 'muscle'). It can influence muscle contraction and movement, and can also contribute to the body's sense of proprioception, which is the awareness of the position and movement of the body. Understanding the role of fascia and myofascia in the human body is crucial, as restrictions or abnormalities in the fascial system can lead to a range of physical ailments, from chronic pain and a decrease in joint mobility, to distortions in postural alignment. Furthermore, understanding the properties of fascia and myofascia can also be beneficial in optimizing human movement and athletic performance, as they can impact flexibility, strength, and coordination. Chapter: Fascia and Movement Fascia plays a critical role in the way we move. It forms a continuous network throughout the body, connecting all our tissues and organs. This allows it to transmit force and tension from one part of the body to another, facilitating coordinated, efficient movement. As fascia exhibits remarkable elastic properties it plays a crucial role in human movement and biomechanics. This connective tissue is capable of storing and releasing elastic energy, much like a spring, which aids in efficient force transmission and movement. When muscles contract and relax, the fascia stretches and recoils, contributing to the overall power and fluidity of the motion. This elasticity not only enhances athletic performance by enabling rapid and forceful movements but also helps in shock absorption, reducing the risk of injury. Understanding and optimizing the elastic properties of fascia through targeted training can lead to improved flexibility, strength, and coordination. In terms of athletic performance, a healthy and well-functioning fascial system can lead to improvements in speed, power, and agility. It can also help to enhance stability and balance, reduce the risk of injury, and increase the efficiency of movement. Chapter: Fascia and Myofascial Release With its crucial role in movement, it's important to keep the fascial system in optimal condition. One way to do this is through myofascial release - a type of physical therapy used to treat myofascial pain syndrome, a chronic pain disorder caused by tightness and sensitivity in the myofascial tissues. Myofascial release often involves applying gentle, sustained pressure to the myofascial connective tissue restrictions, with the aim of eliminating pain and restoring motion. Regularly performing myofascial release exercises can help to keep the fascia supple and flexible, which can in turn improve movement, enhance athletic performance, and prevent injuries."

This intricate system is composed of several key components: the brain, which serves as the control center; the spinal cord, which acts as a major conduit for signals; and the peripheral nerves, which transmit vital signals between the brain and various parts of the body. Together, these elements work seamlessly to ensure that our movements are both accurate and well-coordinated, allowing us to carry out a wide range of activities with ease. Chapter: Components of the Nervous System The brain, as the control center, processes and interprets the information it receives from the sensory organs and initiates appropriate responses. It is divided into several regions, each responsible for different functions, such as movement, sensation, and cognition. The cerebellum, for example, is crucial for coordinating voluntary movements and maintaining balance and posture. The cerebral cortex, on the other hand, is involved in higher-order functions, such as planning and executing movements. The spinal cord serves as a critical communication channel between the brain and the peripheral nerves. It is a long, cylindrical structure that runs down the vertebral column and is protected by the vertebrae. The spinal cord contains bundles of nerve fibers that transmit signals to and from the brain. These signals control reflexes and voluntary movements and also relay sensory information from the body to the brain. The brain as the control center is divided into several regions like the cerebellum or the cerebral cortex which are important for movements, balance, posture and planning of movement. The spinal cord serves as a critical communication channel between the brain and the peripheral nerves. Chapter: Components of the Nervous System Peripheral nerves extend from the spinal cord to various parts of the body, including the limbs and organs. These nerves are responsible for transmitting motor commands from the brain to the muscles and conveying sensory information from the body back to the brain. Peripheral nerves are classified into two main types: sensory nerves, which carry information from sensory receptors to the brain, and motor nerves, which transmit commands from the brain to the muscles. Chapter: Interaction Between Nervous and Muscular Systems Peripheral nerves extend from the spinal cord to various parts of the body, including the limbs and organs. These nerves are responsible for transmitting motor commands from the brain to the muscles and conveying sensory information from the body back to the brain. Peripheral nerves are classified into two main types: sensory nerves, which carry information from sensory receptors to the brain, and motor nerves, which transmit commands from the brain to the muscles. Let's move on by breaking down the incredible teamwork between our nervous and muscular systems. This dynamic duo is the secret sauce behind every burpee, sled push and war ball in your hiro's journey. Think about motor neurons as your body's lightning fast courier service. They are zipping messages from your brain and spinal cord to your muscles, orchestrating every move you make. These messages jump across synapses. Imagine these as cellular relay stations keeping the communication flowing. Now, here's where it gets interesting. Your muscles and tendons come equipped with their own high-tech sensors. Muscle spindles are like built-in fitness trackers, constantly monitoring change in muscle lengths. They are key players in maintaining your form and posture throughout those challenging high rock stations. And don't overlook the gorgy tendon organs. These are your body's natural safety valves. They are always on guard, monitoring muscle tension and ready to hit the brakes if you're pushing too hard, potentially saving your athletes from an injury. Grasping this intricate interplay between the nervous and muscular systems can elevate the game of your hierar athletes. It's all about fine tuning that mind muscle connection for peak performance. Chapter: Neural Circuits and Movement Coordination The precise coordination of muscle activity is achieved through complex neural circuits that integrate sensory input, motor commands, and feedback mechanisms. These circuits involve various regions of the brain, including the motor cortex, basal ganglia, and cerebellum. The motor cortex generates the initial motor commands, which are refined and modulated by the basal ganglia and cerebellum to produce smooth and accurate movements. Chapter: Additional Insights on the Neocortex and Brain Predictions In this concise overview of the nervous system, we aim to highlight two additional crucial areas. First, the Neocortex. The Neocortex is our brain’s “filing cabinet” and collects information from our senses, checks in with previous experience with those inputs, and finally decides how to respond. This sophisticated part of the brain plays a crucial role in sensory perception, spatial reasoning, conscious thought, and language. By referencing past experiences, the Neocortex enables us to make informed decisions, adapt to new situations, and refine our movements and reactions based on what has worked well before. The second point to make is that the brain is a prediction machine and is always trying to prepare in advance of demand. Based on inputs and cues from the environment, the brain makes those predictions to ensure smooth and efficient functioning of the body. For instance, when an athlete prepares to jump, the brain anticipates the necessary muscle contractions and joint movements required for the action. However, if the prediction is wrong, this can have a negative impact on performance, sometimes devastatingly so. Incorrect predictions can lead to misaligned movements, increased risk of injury, and suboptimal performance outcomes. Understanding these two key functions of the nervous system is essential for coaches. By recognizing how the Neocortex processes sensory information and how the brain anticipates future demands, coaches can better design training programs that enhance an athlete's ability to make accurate predictions and adapt to varying conditions. This insight can lead to improved performance, reduced injury risk, and more effective training strategies. Chapter: Summary and Importance for Coaches In summary, the nervous system is essential for controlling and coordinating muscle actions, enabling us to perform complex and precise movements. The brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nerves work together to transmit signals between the brain and the rest of the body. Motor neurons, sensory receptors, and neural circuits facilitate the interaction between the nervous system and the muscular system, ensuring that our movements are well-coordinated and efficient. Understanding the intricate workings of the nervous system is crucial for optimizing athletic performance and developing effective training programs."

For coaches aiming to develop advanced training programs and guide hierar athletes to peak performance, Phil's insight offer valuable perspectives that can enhance your coaching approach. We invite you to explore the world of biomechanics with Doctor Phil Graham Smith. His expertise will provide you with a new lens through which to view and optimize HYROX training. Biomechanics can be defined as the study of human movement with respect to how the musculoskeletal system generates force to create movement and how it responds to loading from external forces. With respect to HYROX we are keen to understand how athletes run and perform the 8 workouts in a safe and efficient way, whilst still pushing their bodies to achieve the best times. As a Level 1 HYROX coach Biomechanics will provide you with a framework based on sound movement principles that will enable you to assess your athlete’s running gait and how they execute of the 8 workouts. As we move through this chapter you will: *Develop an understanding of fundamental biomechanical principles relating to force and motion *Learn how to analyze a workout exercise by breaking it down into phases of movement, associating biomechanical principles to successful performance outcomes *Use the skills to identify common errors in HYROX workouts Chapter: Fundamental Principles Before we delve into the practical aspects of analyzing movement, we need to develop an understanding of some fundamental terminology, concepts and principles, which are essential for Functional Anatomy and Biomechanics. When we show up to the present moment with all of our senses, we invite the world to fill us with joy. The pains of the past are behind us. The future has yet to unfold. But the now is full of beauty simply waiting for our attention. When describing human movement, we typically refer to 3 planes of movement about 3 axes of rotation. The sagittal plane bisects the body down the middle separating it into left and right, where movements occur around the frontal axis. Swinging the arms or legs forwards and backwards (flexion-extension) about the shoulder or hips joints are examples are movement in the sagittal plane. The frontal plane bisects the body separating it into front and back, where movements occur around the sagittal axis. Abducting and adducting the arms or legs in a star jump is an example of movement in the frontal plane. The transverse plane bisects the body separating it into upper and lower parts, where movements occur around the longitudinal axis. Rotating or twisting the upper body whilst standing upright is an example of movement in the transverse plane. Chapter: Further Terminology for Describing Human Movement All right, HYORX coaches, let's set the stage for our journey into biomechanics. In the next few graphics, we are going to break down some key scientific terms. We'll be looking at how we describe human movement, the planes of motion, and the axis of rotation. Now, I know this might sound like complex concepts, but don't worry, we are going to make them crystal clear. Why is this important? you ask. Well, these graphics are going to give us all a common language. Think of it as building a shared vocabulary that we will use throughout our discussion of functional anatomy and biomechanics. By understanding these basics, you'll be better equipped to grasp the more advanced concepts we'll cover later. So let's dive in and start building that foundation. Trust me, this knowledge will be invaluable as we explore how the human body moves and functions in the context of HYROX training and performance. Are you ready? Let's go."

Over time, the word found its way into various languages with similar meanings. In English, \"flexibility\" emerged in the late 17th century, referring to the quality of being flexible or adaptable. In contemporary usage, \"flexibility\" has a wide range of applications: Materially The ability of a material to deform elastically and return to its original shape when the applied stress is removed. Personality Trait The range of different appropriate behavioral responses a person can make in situations that they face. Physical The ability of muscles and joints to move through a full range of motion without causing injury or strain. Within the physical domain it is also possible to make a distinction between static flexibility and dynamic flexibility. Static flexibility, also known as passive flexibility or stationary flexibility, refers to the range of motion a joint or a group of joints can achieve while at rest or during a slow, controlled stretch. An example of static flexibility could be the distance during a ‘sit and reach’ test. Dynamic flexibility involves the range of motion around a joint or a group of joints during active movements, typically performed with controlled speed and momentum. An example of dynamic flexibility could be standing leg swings. Chapter: Why is flexibility important? Static flexibility is crucial for various reasons. It plays a fundamental role in injury prevention and overall joint health. Good static flexibility reduces the risk of muscle strains, joint sprains, and other injuries related to limited mobility. Additionally, static flexibility is vital for improving posture and reducing muscle imbalances. Sedentary lifestyles and prolonged periods of sitting can lead to decreased flexibility, affecting posture negatively. Dynamic flexibility is crucial for activities that involve constant movement, agility, and coordination. It is especially important in sports and physical activities that require a full range of motion and the ability to perform dynamic movements seamlessly. Furthermore, dynamic flexibility contributes to improved athletic performance. Athletes engaging in dynamic stretches before activities may experience enhanced power, speed, and agility. These stretches also increase blood flow to the muscles, optimizing oxygen delivery and nutrient supply, which can positively impact endurance and overall exercise performance. Combining static and dynamic flexibility exercises in a comprehensive fitness routine offers a holistic approach to overall flexibility and functional movement. Good static flexibility contributes to the prevention of stiffness and reduces the risk of injury. On the other hand, dynamic stretches prepare the body for specific activities, improving mobility, coordination, and performance during dynamic movements. Together, they contribute to a balanced musculoskeletal system, fostering improved posture, reduced injury risk, and enhanced athletic performance. Hence, the synergy between static and dynamic flexibility creates a well-rounded foundation for physical health. This makes it also an important factor in HYROX. Especially for exercises like burpees, rowing and wall balls it is very advantageous to have good joint health and mobility. Without it, these exercises become much more difficult to complete. Chapter: Which physiological factors are important for flexibility? Flexibility is influenced by various physiological factors, and understanding these factors can provide insights into how to enhance and maintain flexibility. Some key physiological factors that play a role in flexibility include: 1. Muscle Elasticity Muscle elasticity refers to the ability of muscles to lengthen and return to their original shape. Muscles with good elasticity allow for a greater range of motion and contribute to overall flexibility. 2. Joint Structure Joint structure, including the type and shape of articulating surfaces, ligaments, and joint capsules can impact the range of motion. Some joints, like ball-and-socket joints, naturally allow for more movement, while hinge joints have more limited ranges. 3. Collagen and Connective Tissues Collagen is a fibrous protein that makes up connective tissues, such as tendons and ligaments. Collagen provides support and stability to joints. Connective tissues with good pliability can maintain proper flexibility. 4. Neuromuscular Control The coordination between the nervous system and muscles to control movement. Efficient neuromuscular control contributes to smooth, controlled movements. Poor neuromuscular control can result in tightness and restrictions in range of motion. 5. Muscle Temperature Warmer muscles tend to be more pliable and elastic. That's why it's advisable to perform dynamic warm-up exercises before the main training session, as the increased muscle temperature facilitates better stretching and reduces the risk of injury. 6. Age Flexibility tends to decrease with age due to changes in muscle elasticity, joint health, and collagen content in connective tissues. 7. Gender In general, females tend to have greater joint laxity and flexibility than males. This difference is influenced by hormonal factors and joint structure variations. Chapter: What are the main adaptations when training for flexibility? Consistent flexibility training can lead to various physiological changes that enhance a person's range of motion and overall flexibility. Here are the main adaptations associated with flexibility training: 1. Increased Muscle Elasticity Regular stretching exercises increases the elasticity of muscles. Improved muscle elasticity allows for a greater range of motion and contributes to increased flexibility. 2. Changes in Connective Tissue Pliability Stretching helps maintain and improve the pliability of connective tissues, including tendons and ligaments. Flexible connective tissues provide support to joints and allow for smoother movement. 3. Neuromuscular Adaptations Flexibility training enhances neuromuscular coordination and control, improving the communication between the nervous system and muscles. This allows for better coordination during movement and helps prevent muscle imbalances that can limit flexibility. 4. Increased Synovial Fluid Production Regular movement and stretching stimulate the production of synovial fluid in joints. Synovial fluid lubricates joints, reducing friction and promoting smoother joint motion. This contributes to improved joint flexibility. 5. Temperature-Related Changes Warmer muscles are more pliable, making them more receptive to stretching."

The word \"speed\" has its origins in Old English and was spelled as \"spēd,\" and it primarily denoted success, prosperity, or good fortune. The evolution of the word's meaning reflects the association between success and the ability to move quickly or efficiently. In medieval times, a prosperous journey or a successful accomplishment was often linked to the speed at which it was carried out. The term \"godspeed,\" derived from Old English and Middle English, was used to wish someone a prosperous and speedy journey. Around the 15th century, \"speed\" had acquired its modern sense of rapid movement or velocity. It became a descriptor for the rate at which an object travels or a task is completed. In contemporary English, \"speed\" is a versatile term used in various contexts: 1. Physics In physics, speed is a scalar quantity that represents the rate at which an object moves, typically measured as the distance traveled per unit of time. Important to realize is the difference with the word ‘velocity’. Velocity is a vector quantity that includes both the speed and the direction of motion. It specifies not only how fast an object is moving but also the direction in which it is moving. 2. Technology In computing, speed may refer to the processing rate or performance of a computer or a network connection. 3. Human Attributes Figuratively, speed can describe a person's quickness of thought, decision-making, or comprehension. 4. Drug Terminology In drug-related contexts, speed can be a colloquial term for amphetamine or methamphetamine, which are stimulant drugs. 5. Sports In sports, speed relates to the swiftness of a player, a single limb or an object in motion. This therefore mainly relates to an athlete's ability to generate and sustain rapid movements. An athlete can manifest speed in different ways in sport. A lot of athletes want to finish a HYROX as fast as possible. However, this does not necessarily mean that you need to have great speed capabilities. All the exercises and the whole race are simply too long to make good use of your maximal speed. Still, exposing yourself regularly to training sessions with high speed can be very effective to improve your HYROX performance. Chapter: Which physiological factors are important for speed? Several physiological factors contribute to an athlete's speed. These factors involve various aspects of the musculoskeletal, cardiovascular systems and the nervous system. Here are key physiological factors that are important for having speed: Neuromuscular Coordination: Efficient communication between the nervous system and muscles is vital for quick and coordinated movements. Speed relies on precise neuromuscular coordination to generate the necessary force for rapid actions. Not only movement speed but also reaction times is heavily influenced by the responsiveness of the nervous system. A fast reaction to stimuli, such as the starting signal in a race, is essential for achieving speed. Biomechanics: Proper biomechanics, including the coordination of joint movements, contribute to high movement speeds. In terms of running, maximizing stride length without compromising frequency is essential for achieving and maintaining speed. Flexibility and Range of Motion: A good range of motion and dynamic flexibility are important for optimal joint function and muscle activation during movements. Flexibility contributes to efficient and unrestricted movement, supporting speed. Anaerobic Energy Systems: The ATP-PC (short term energy) system provides rapid energy for short bursts of high-intensity activity, such as sprinting. This system is crucial for the immediate energy demands of speed. Importantly, the other energy systems are important for the recovery of the ATP-PC system, making overall conditioning also important for high speed efforts. Body Composition: Favorable body composition, with an appropriate balance of lean muscle mass, contributes to power-to-weight ratio. This ratio is relevant for activities that demand rapid acceleration and sustained maximal speeds. In summary, achieving and optimizing speed involves a combination of factors related to muscle strength, biomechanics, neuromuscular coordination, energy systems and overall conditioning. Specific training programs tailored to enhance these physiological factors are key to improving an athlete's speed. Chapter: What are the main adaptations when training for speed? Training for speed involves specific physiological adaptations to enhance an athlete's ability to generate and sustain rapid movements. Here are the main physiological adaptations that occur when training for speed: 1. Neurological improvements A lot of crucial adaptations after speed training are neurologically. Firstly, speed training can improve the neurological firing frequency. Neurological firing frequency refers to the rate at which nerve impulses are transmitted between neurons, influencing the speed and coordination of muscle contractions during movement. Another key adaptation is improved neuromuscular coordination, improving the efficiency of communication between the nervous system and muscles. Improved coordination allows for more precise and synchronized movements, optimizing the initiation and execution of rapid actions. Third adaptation is an improved reaction time due to faster responsiveness of the nervous system. Quicker reaction times improve the athlete's ability to initiate rapid movements, crucial for sprint starts and rapid changes of direction. The last neurological improvement is increased Muscle Fiber Recruitment. Speed training stimulates the recruitment and activation of fast-twitch muscle fibers, which are responsible for powerful and rapid contractions. Enhanced recruitment of fast-twitch fibers contributes to increased force production and explosive power during sprinting or other high-speed movements. 2. Increased Strength and Power: Speed training can lead to increased strength and power. In terms of running, greater strength and power contribute to forceful ground contact, aiding in the generation of rapid accelerations during sprinting. 3. Enhanced Anaerobic Energy Systems: Intense speed training develops the anaerobic energy systems, particularly the ATP-PC system, which provides rapid energy for short bursts of high-intensity activity. 4. Optimized Biomechanics and Stride Mechanics: Speed training includes drills and exercises to optimize biomechanics and stride mechanics during sprinting. When taking running again as the example, improved mechanics help maximize stride length and frequency, enhancing overall running efficiency and speed. Incorporating these physiological adaptations through targeted speed training programs can significantly enhance an athlete's capacity to generate high-speed movements. It's essential to design training protocols that address the specific demands of the sport and progressively challenge the athlete's speed capabilities. Chapter: Interview --> 00:00:09.679 Welcome to the next interview. --> 00:00:11.839 Next to me is Machiel van Kolck. --> 00:00:14.119 He also works as a strength and conditioning coach --> 00:00:17.640 here at Papendal and you have experience in various sports. --> 00:00:21.000 So what can you tell us about speed --> 00:00:22.519 in the sports that you worked in? --> 00:00:26.679 - So yeah, I've worked in, at the moment in judo --> 00:00:29.679 and snowboard freestyle, but in previous times --> 00:00:32.039 I've worked in rugby as well in gymnastics. --> 00:00:35.840 So we'll have a look at rugby from a speed perspective --> 00:00:38.200 because that's probably the closest that comes to HYROX --> 00:00:40.159 and helps a bit of explaining anyway. --> 00:00:44.880 So for rugby speed, it's like any game defining moment --> 00:00:47.600 in rugby, if that's a break or beating a defender --> 00:00:50.920 or breaking away on a score try, --> 00:00:54.039 all these things happen a lot at speed. --> 00:00:57.520 So generally the athletes that possess the highest amount --> 00:01:00.200 of acceleration, slash speed, slash top speed --> 00:01:04.680 will come away with a score or a try --> 00:01:10.519 or break the line or any game defining moment does so. --> 00:01:13.079 - Yeah, and how did you work with speed --> 00:01:17.120 into your programs while being a coach for rugby? --> 00:01:23.239 - Well, speed is basically the highest form of energy --> 00:01:25.920 expenditure or what our body can produce --> 00:01:27.040 or any maximal sprint. --> 00:01:29.640 We really want our athletes to be fresh. --> 00:01:33.560 We don't want them come at the back end of a, --> 00:01:35.920 say the night before we did a lactate session --> 00:01:39.000 or any heavy strength session or a lower body --> 00:01:42.319 or rugby session, then the next morning we can't really --> 00:01:45.239 be fresh and produce our highest top speed. --> 00:01:49.760 So we try to put it in the week where we are the most fresh --> 00:01:53.760 and we don't come at the back end of any heavy --> 00:01:58.120 lower body training or any running conditioning session. --> 00:01:59.439 - Yeah. - Type of stuff. --> 00:01:59.959 - Yeah, logical. --> 00:02:02.519 And when we make the connection to a HYROX, --> 00:02:05.280 like HYROX is a mix of strength and endurance --> 00:02:07.680 and you maybe don't need any like top speed, --> 00:02:10.000 but you do want to be as fast as possible. --> 00:02:13.120 So what would be the role of speed for your, --> 00:02:15.599 for your, yeah, in your opinion for HYROX? --> 00:02:19.800 - Well, generally speaking, if you can run fast --> 00:02:23.400 or produce a higher top speed, then we raise our ceiling --> 00:02:26.400 of how fast we can run or how fast we can do stuff. --> 00:02:30.879 So if we raise our ceiling, then the theory says --> 00:02:32.840 that everything below there becomes easier as well. --> 00:02:35.759 So when we raise our ceiling, we also raise our, --> 00:02:37.080 the floor. --> 00:02:41.240 So I mean, if, if it leaves us over with energy --> 00:02:46.080 to do our normal runs, that, that can be easier then. --> 00:02:48.599 If we can run fast and anything below that becomes easier. --> 00:02:51.000 So that running probably also becomes easier. --> 00:02:55.400 Looking at HYROX as well. --> 00:02:57.520 So you'll have something left in the tank. --> 00:03:01.319 Whenever we need to give that little bit of extra --> 00:03:05.039 or a little bit, I need three extra WallBalls quickly --> 00:03:07.680 before I can chase the guy or --> 00:03:08.879 give a little extra sprint. --> 00:03:11.680 We have that in our tank to be able to do that --> 00:03:13.439 and then go back to our race pace. --> 00:03:15.520 And then, so it leaves us extra, --> 00:03:17.360 gives us something extra to produce. --> 00:03:20.039 - Yeah. And if like a HYROX coach --> 00:03:24.080 or a HYROX athlete has the idea of himself, like, --> 00:03:25.560 oh, I need to work on my speed. --> 00:03:26.879 How would you do that? --> 00:03:30.719 What are practical tips in, in like a week of training --> 00:03:31.639 for that person? --> 00:03:36.280 - Well, I need, try out a actual maximal sprint. --> 00:03:41.039 So just go to the track and look to sprint anywhere --> 00:03:43.439 between 30 and even a hundred meters --> 00:03:45.759 and then do that at max effort. --> 00:03:50.560 And then rest roughly a minute --> 00:03:53.240 for every 10 meters you sprint it --> 00:03:55.680 or even more to have complete rest --> 00:03:58.479 if that's what you need or that's what you feel. --> 00:04:05.439 And then see how you go because it also has a injury --> 00:04:09.439 prevention because it's, our muscles will go hard. --> 00:04:11.599 It's our most max effort. --> 00:04:15.080 So it's also injury prevention, but also, yeah, --> 00:04:18.199 have a max sprint, have a look at it, --> 00:04:23.079 feel how it is and add it into your training. --> 00:04:25.480 And not just even maximal sprinting, --> 00:04:30.759 but it can also be our max 200 meters, 400 meters, --> 00:04:31.720 100 meters even. --> 00:04:35.639 We need to rest a little bit longer than three, four, --> 00:04:38.959 five minutes, maybe even 15 minutes if we do 400s. --> 00:04:42.560 But do anything as fresh as you can --> 00:04:44.519 with the most maximum intensity as you can --> 00:04:46.160 and rest as long as you can. --> 00:04:48.879 So we wanna do speed while we refresh, --> 00:04:50.759 while we can produce the max most, --> 00:04:51.759 maximal effort we can. --> 00:04:53.120 - Yeah, sounds good. --> 00:04:55.040 So thanks for this interview. --> 00:04:58.519 You learned everything about speed there is now --> 00:05:01.480 and thanks for your time and I hope you enjoyed it. --> 00:05:02.360 - Thanks for having me. --> 00:05:02.959 - Yeah, nice."

The word \"power\" has a rich history, originating from the Latin term \"potere,\" meaning \"to be able\" or \"to have the ability.\" Old French adopted the term as \"pouoir,\" signifying authority or control. The Middle English period further shaped the term into \"pouer\" or \"power,\" encompassing a broad spectrum of meanings related to authority, control, ability, and force. Throughout history, the concept of power has been central to political, social, and philosophical discourse. Philosophers like Thomas Hobbes and John Locke explored the nature of political power, while scholars like Michel Foucault delved into the complexities of power as a pervasive force shaping societal structures. The nuanced evolution of the word \"power\" underscores its dynamic and multifaceted character, encompassing notions of strength, authority, influence, and the capacity to effect change. Different meanings of the word power nowadays are: 1. Political and Social Context In political discourse, power refers to the ability to influence or control the behaviour of individuals or groups. It encompasses political authority and the capacity to make decisions that impact society. 2. Electrical and Mechanical Context In physics and engineering, power represents the rate at which work is done or energy is transferred. It is a measure of the ability to perform tasks and is often quantified in watts. 3. Economic Context In economics, power can denote the control or influence one entity has over resources, markets, or economic policies. It reflects the ability to shape economic conditions. 4. Physical Performance In the context of physical performance, power refers to the combination of strength and speed, emphasizing the ability to generate force quickly. In sports and fitness, it is crucial for activities requiring explosive movements, such as sprinting, jumping, or lifting weights. Power is a key factor in achieving maximal performance and is often developed through targeted training regimens focused on enhancing both strength and speed. Just like in the mechanical context, physical power is something that can be measured. Just think about the power (in watts) performed on the SkiErg, Bike or Rower. These measurements can be done with the following formula: Power (in Watts) = Force (in Newton) x Velocity (in m/s). This formula results that power can be defined as the ability to exert the highest amount of Force in the shortest amount of time. The link between Power and HYROX is most easily made with the SkiErg and Row. During these exercises it is even possible to see the amount of power you produce on the screen. That is the combination of the force and speed you produce on the handle(s). But just like the factor strength, you need power for everything during HYROX. Another great example are the Wall Balls. During this exercise you need to produce enough power to throw the ball all the way to the target. When the amount of produced power is too low, you won’t reach it. Chapter: Which physiological factors are important for power? Since power is the product of both strength and speed, the main physiological factors important for power are, not surprisingly, the same that are important for strength and speed. A short summary of these factors are listed below: Muscle Fiber Type Type II fibers, particularly Type IIb, are associated with higher force production and are crucial for explosive movements. Muscle Cross-Sectional Area The ability of the nervous system to recruit and activate motor units influences power. Muscle Architecture Muscles with a greater pennation angle may have a higher force-producing potential. Tendon Stiffness Greater tendon stiffness is associated with enhanced force transmission and can contribute to strength and power. Biomechanics Proper biomechanics, including the coordination of joint movements, contribute to high movement speeds. Flexibility and Range of Motion A good range of motion and dynamic flexibility are important for optimal joint function and muscle activation. Anaerobic Energy Systems The ATP-PC (short term energy) system provides rapid energy for short bursts of high-intensity activity. Body Composition Favorable body composition contributes to power-to-weight ratio. Chapter: What are the main adaptations when training for power? Just like the main physiological factors for power, the main adaptations when training for power are very similar to those for both speed and strength. A short summary of these adaptations are listed below: 1. Muscle Hypertrophy Power training can stimulate the growth of muscle fibers. 2. Muscle Fiber Type Adaptations Although limited, some training programs may induce shifts in muscle fiber types. 3. Increased Energy Storage and Utilization Strength and power training improves the energy storage capacity of muscles and enhances the efficiency of energy utilization during contractions. 4. Enhanced Muscle Architecture Regular strength training may lead to changes in muscle architecture, such as an increase in pennation angle. 5. Neurological improvements Improved neurological firing frequency Improved neuromuscular coordination Improved reaction time Increased Muscle Fiber Recruitment 6. Enhanced Anaerobic Energy Systems Intense power training develops the anaerobic energy systems. 7. Optimized Biomechanics Speed and power training includes drills and exercises to optimize biomechanics. Important addition is that not all of these adaptations have to occur. Also, some of these adaptations may even be undesirable for a particular athlete. Some athletes may want to become more powerful, without adding more muscle mass. This can be important for sports where body mass plays an important role like for instance Running, Team-Sports, Olympic Weightlifting, Boxing, Judo and many more. Those athletes could try to improve their power by focussing on neurological adaptations and optimized biomechanics. Similarly, some athletes are already very fast, but maybe lack the pure strength which limits their power producing capabilities. An example of this could be a volleyball player which lacks jump height not because of his/her speed, but because of his/her strength. In this case it could be beneficial to put some effort into adding a bit of muscle mass, despite it also increasing the athletes total body mass. Chapter: Interview --> 00:00:09.480 So welcome to the next interview. --> 00:00:11.359 Next to me is Matt Solomon. --> 00:00:14.359 He is a colleague of mine here at the Dutch Olympic team --> 00:00:16.440 and he works as a strength and conditioning coach --> 00:00:18.199 and also a sports scientist. --> 00:00:20.960 Matt, what is the role of power --> 00:00:23.640 in the sport that you work in, --> 00:00:25.280 in the different sports that you work in? --> 00:00:26.519 I think to start with, --> 00:00:27.640 it's good to name the different sports --> 00:00:28.839 and I know the role of power. --> 00:00:31.480 So wheelchair basketball, table tennis, ski, --> 00:00:32.799 and snowboard, all Paralympic. --> 00:00:35.399 So obviously that's upper body power in some --> 00:00:36.560 and lower body power in others. --> 00:00:38.640 But we take wheelchair basketball for example, --> 00:00:41.159 that's the one that I work most of my days with, --> 00:00:41.719 almost in hours. --> 00:00:44.159 The role is pretty simple. --> 00:00:46.560 Obviously you need to score more baskets in your opponent, --> 00:00:47.920 but to do that, you're gonna need to get --> 00:00:49.880 into the best positions and you're gonna have --> 00:00:52.039 some one-on-one duels and you need to win those. --> 00:00:56.359 Really simply, there's a little metal edge --> 00:00:58.039 around the wheelchair and you need to get that --> 00:00:59.920 in front of your opposition. --> 00:01:01.640 If you can do that, then you pretty much won --> 00:01:02.799 because they can't get around you. --> 00:01:06.599 So the power involves breaking inertia, --> 00:01:08.239 so your body weight, a little bit of friction. --> 00:01:09.920 You've got to break inertia in the wheelchair, --> 00:01:12.120 you've got to get around your opponent and after that, --> 00:01:13.640 all you've got to do is express that power --> 00:01:14.359 as quickly as you can. --> 00:01:16.760 Yeah, so power is, like you said, --> 00:01:18.719 a very important factor in your sport. --> 00:01:21.640 So how do you use that into your SNC programs? --> 00:01:22.719 How do you train for it? --> 00:01:25.480 - So obviously power is the rate of work, right? --> 00:01:27.239 And you can define that in different ways, --> 00:01:28.920 depending on whether you're a biomechanist --> 00:01:30.519 or in strength and conditioning or whatever, --> 00:01:32.400 but we want to produce work quickly. --> 00:01:36.200 And to do that, you're gonna need different types of power. --> 00:01:38.079 So you have, for example, eccentric rate of force --> 00:01:39.920 development, concentric rate of force development, --> 00:01:42.519 or using a stretch-shortening cycle, using elasticity. --> 00:01:46.239 Depending on the different actions that you use, --> 00:01:47.439 it's gonna depend on which one you need. --> 00:01:50.400 And then working back from that, you need to be strong, --> 00:01:53.400 so you need to be able to produce a large amount of force, --> 00:01:54.680 and you need to be able to do that quickly. --> 00:01:56.640 So you need to work on both ends of those spectrums. --> 00:01:59.879 So it's get strong, get fast. --> 00:02:01.680 And then you can combine those two. --> 00:02:03.879 So for our higher-level athletes who are strong and fast, --> 00:02:06.480 then we can work more on the specific power. --> 00:02:08.800 And you can think about things like a bench press --> 00:02:11.039 between maybe 60 and 75%. --> 00:02:13.719 You can progress that using bands, for example. --> 00:02:16.080 So when you get strong at a particular weight --> 00:02:18.680 and you get fast, if you're gonna really force up --> 00:02:19.879 with bench press, at some point, --> 00:02:20.759 you're gonna fly off the bench. --> 00:02:23.719 So using bands that stop you from flying off a bench, --> 00:02:26.520 and you can keep producing force throughout that movement. --> 00:02:29.080 Other options for pull movements, for example, --> 00:02:30.360 you can use a bench row. --> 00:02:32.479 And I know they're not particularly available --> 00:02:34.960 in commercial gyms, but like a hollow bench --> 00:02:36.639 where you can pull up the bar --> 00:02:38.319 all the way to almost your chest. --> 00:02:41.520 And you can use those for speed --> 00:02:43.360 and obviously for strength as well. --> 00:02:45.319 So those are two examples, --> 00:02:47.520 but I really like programming that --> 00:02:49.759 in the first part of the session, --> 00:02:51.759 alongside some ballistic stuff as well. --> 00:02:53.400 So you can think about maybe a shot put --> 00:02:55.680 with a medicine ball or medicine ball slams, --> 00:02:58.319 different variations to produce force really quickly. --> 00:03:00.319 And of course, in those three different domains --> 00:03:02.159 that we just mentioned, so eccentrically, --> 00:03:03.800 concentrically and isometrically. --> 00:03:04.919 - Yeah, sounds really good. --> 00:03:05.879 Get strong, get fast. --> 00:03:07.280 I will remember that one. --> 00:03:10.520 So now we will make the connection to a HYROX. --> 00:03:13.159 What is your thoughts about --> 00:03:15.120 the role of power in HYROX? --> 00:03:18.879 - So the entire sport is doing a set amount of work --> 00:03:19.919 as quickly as possible, right? --> 00:03:22.120 So technically it's all power, but it's not --> 00:03:23.800 because there's different energy systems in play. --> 00:03:26.919 And ultimately you're limited by those energy systems --> 00:03:28.120 as opposed to maximum power. --> 00:03:30.199 I don't think anyone who's coming into HYROX --> 00:03:31.639 can't have one wall ball. --> 00:03:33.400 So the maximum, the maximum power, --> 00:03:34.520 I don't think that's the limit. --> 00:03:37.800 But being able to produce that over time certainly is. --> 00:03:40.599 And the advantage to having a high maximum power --> 00:03:42.439 is that let's say for example, you're gonna do, --> 00:03:44.840 you're on the SkiErg. --> 00:03:47.719 And let's say your maximum wattage --> 00:03:49.919 for a five second sprint is a thousand watts. --> 00:03:53.080 Well, if you're gonna have to work at 500 watts, --> 00:03:54.719 then you work at 50%. --> 00:03:56.520 So that feels relatively easy. --> 00:03:59.439 If your maximum is 500, then you have to work at 100%. --> 00:04:00.520 You can't do it. --> 00:04:05.319 So in that sense, making a higher maximum --> 00:04:07.360 gives you a potential and therefore, --> 00:04:10.439 the relative amount feels easier. --> 00:04:12.599 So that's one way that it could really benefit. --> 00:04:15.120 I think the other way is probably not looked at too much --> 00:04:18.399 is using elasticity as a form of power. --> 00:04:19.759 So that's straight shortening cycle that you mentioned. --> 00:04:23.800 For example, running economy can be significantly improved --> 00:04:27.839 by having more elasticity in your ankles, knees and hips. --> 00:04:30.240 So instead of running like an elephant, --> 00:04:31.639 really kind of like heavy and hard, --> 00:04:33.560 running with a springy step --> 00:04:34.879 could be a real benefit as well. --> 00:04:37.839 So I think power in those senses is really important. --> 00:04:40.120 I just think that it combines --> 00:04:41.680 with lots of other elements as well. --> 00:04:43.959 It's not just pure, you need to produce maximum power. --> 00:04:45.800 Otherwise, they would all be power lifters, right? --> 00:04:48.399 And let's say I'm a coach who, --> 00:04:50.120 and I coach different athletes, --> 00:04:51.399 or I'm an athlete myself, --> 00:04:53.399 and I want to improve my maximum power. --> 00:04:55.240 Do you have any practical tips --> 00:04:57.240 for any HYROX athletes or coaches --> 00:04:58.680 to improve that maximum power? --> 00:05:01.240 - Yeah, so I think first things first, --> 00:05:02.720 improving maximum power means --> 00:05:04.000 you need to be really well rested. --> 00:05:05.680 And that's the one thing that I think most people, --> 00:05:08.079 especially when they come out of like an endurance --> 00:05:09.399 or a lactate type sport, --> 00:05:10.600 I think that's the thing that --> 00:05:12.199 they're gonna mess up the most. --> 00:05:13.680 And you really need to take your rest. --> 00:05:15.439 So no matter what you're doing, --> 00:05:16.680 I'm gonna, you can talk about --> 00:05:17.759 sets and reps in just a second, --> 00:05:19.560 but take the rest to recover maximum. --> 00:05:20.759 And if you do that, --> 00:05:22.519 then you can produce maximum force again, --> 00:05:24.639 and that's how you can train that physical quality. --> 00:05:26.800 So depending on the exercise --> 00:05:28.319 and depending on the movement that you're gonna do, --> 00:05:31.160 anywhere between potentially 40 and 80%, --> 00:05:33.279 maybe 90% if you're one rep max, --> 00:05:34.600 so let's take a back squat. --> 00:05:36.680 If you know you can squat 100 kilos, --> 00:05:38.120 you could improve your power --> 00:05:40.279 by doing a jump squat of 40 kilos, --> 00:05:41.959 all the way up to maybe 80. --> 00:05:45.959 By doing that at the start of the training session, --> 00:05:48.759 then you're gonna be fresh, so you're not tired, --> 00:05:50.959 and you're gonna need lots of rest in between, --> 00:05:52.639 maybe three to five repetitions, --> 00:05:55.800 so work on really that peak power, and then rest. --> 00:05:58.519 As opposed to what I think a lot of people would wanna do, --> 00:05:59.800 especially coming from a HYROX background, --> 00:06:02.279 is going, \"Right, okay, I'm gonna do three minutes --> 00:06:04.439 of jump squats, and I'm gonna get tired.\" --> 00:06:06.680 Well, maybe your first repetition is really good, --> 00:06:08.920 but you're gonna really taper off here, --> 00:06:11.399 as opposed to maybe doing three to five sets --> 00:06:13.360 of three to five reps, that's what, --> 00:06:14.800 maximally 25 repetitions, --> 00:06:16.560 and taking lots of rest in between. --> 00:06:18.759 So combining exercises like that --> 00:06:20.439 with some plyometric exercises, --> 00:06:23.800 so for example, you can warm up using skipping rope, --> 00:06:25.279 that's really good for ankle stiffness, --> 00:06:28.600 you can then move on to things like hurdle jumps, --> 00:06:31.120 and you can progress those through hurdle jumps --> 00:06:32.120 with a stick landing, --> 00:06:33.800 so you're gonna stand still every time, --> 00:06:37.720 and you can move on to quicker and quicker versions --> 00:06:38.560 of that movement. --> 00:06:40.839 Moving through if you're at a high level --> 00:06:43.879 to things like drop jumps, so more intense plyometrics, --> 00:06:46.399 to really work on that quick contact time, --> 00:06:47.399 and that stiffness and movement. --> 00:06:49.839 - So that's a lot of information, --> 00:06:51.279 thanks about all your ideas. --> 00:06:53.839 So this is the end of the interview about power. --> 00:06:55.720 Matt, I wanna thank you a lot --> 00:06:59.000 for all these interesting thoughts and ideas, --> 00:07:02.319 and also practical examples, so that's really nice. --> 00:07:06.319 So thanks again, and hopefully you enjoyed it."

Its roots trace back to the Latin word \"fitness,\" derived from \"fitus,\" meaning \"suitability.\" In the 16th century, the term gained prominence in English, referring to the state of being fit or suitable for a particular purpose. In the 19th century, the famous Charles Darwin used the word ‘fitness’ to describe his theory of Natural Selection. Here the word ‘fitness’ refers to an organism's ability to survive and reproduce in its environment, contributing to the passing on of its genes to subsequent generations. However, in the 19th century the concept of physical fitness also began to emerge in response to societal shifts, including industrialization and urbanization. As lifestyles became more sedentary, concerns about health and well-being grew. The 20th century witnessed a surge in interest and understanding of fitness, influenced by events such as World War I and II, where physical conditioning played a crucial role in military training. As scientific advancements deepened our understanding of human physiology, the definition of fitness expanded beyond mere physical strength to include cardiovascular endurance, flexibility, and body composition. The late 20th century saw the fitness industry boom, with gyms, personal trainers, and diverse workout regimens becoming mainstream. In recent decades, the concept of holistic well-being has further shaped the meaning of fitness. Mental and emotional aspects are now integral to the understanding of a healthy, fit lifestyle. The term has also permeated digital realms, with fitness apps and online communities promoting a comprehensive approach to health. Chapter: How to analyse and improve sport-specific fitness? In a later stage we will dive deeper into the training strategies and adaptations regarding the individual performance pillars (strength, endurance etc.). Now we will start with providing a broad framework that helps you to analyze and plan your next steps when the goal is to improve sport-specific fitness. Establish a clear goal It all starts with a view on the horizon. What would you, your friends, family or clients like to achieve in the sport? With these goals it’s crucial to make sure it is ‘SMART’ formulated. SMART formulation stands for: (S)pecific: Clearly define the goal and be precise about what you want to accomplish. This helps in providing a clear direction and reduces ambiguity. Without specificity, the goal might be vague and open to interpretation, leading to confusion and even potential conflict (M)easurable: Establish measurable criteria to track progress and determine when the goal has been achieved. Quantifiable indicators make it easier to evaluate success and provide a basis for feedback and adjustments, while the absence makes it challenging to track progress or determine when the goal has been successfully achieved. This lack of quantifiable indicators can hinder accountability and evaluation. (A)chievable: Ensure that the goal is realistic and attainable. Consider the available resources, skills, and time. An achievable goal is challenging but not so difficult that it becomes demotivating or impossible to reach. Unrealistic goals can lead to frustration, demotivation, and a sense of futility. (R)elevant: Align the goal with broader objectives and ensure its relevance to the overall mission or purpose. This step helps in preventing the pursuit of goals that may not contribute significantly to the organization's or individual's success. A goal that is not aligned with broader objectives or lacks relevance to the overall mission of an organization can result in wasted resources and efforts. (T)ime-bound: Set a specific timeframe or deadline for achieving the goal. This adds a sense of urgency and helps in preventing procrastination. A time-bound goal provides a clear target for completion. The absence of a specific timeframe can lead to procrastination, delays, and a lack of motivation to take action prompt Identify the requirements... ...to achieve your goal: Make sure to understand the specific physical demands to achieve your goal. These demands will not only depend upon your sport, but also upon and your goal within the sport. To identify the requirements for a sport I would focus on the following things: Understand the sport: Make sure that factors like the overall goal, philosophy, (unwritten) rules, dynamic and atmosphere of the sport are all clear. Break the physical demands down by the individual performance pillars: This we will touch upon in more detail later. Analyze and experiment with different methods used in the sport (i.e. the burpees during a HYROX) Determine the discrepancy... ...between your current performance level and the desired requirements: Once you establish the physical requirements necessary to achieve your goal and your current performance level it is possible to analyze the discrepancy between the two. This analysis will not only help you get a better understanding of what and how much you need to improve, but can also help you to set interim goals. These interim goals can especially be helpful when you work over a very long period of time. Determine what you need... ...to close the discrepancy between your current performance and the desired performance: Achieving a goal asks a lot more than only doing the work during your training sessions. You also need to think about the following questions: How many hours of training do I ideally need (i.e. each week)? And how am I going to fit that into my schedule? What kind of material do I need to have effective training sessions (e.g. running shoes, sport clothes, gym with HYROX specific material)? Do I have methods to evaluate to what extent I follow the prescribed training session (see step 6) and the overall effectiveness of the plan (see step 7); and do I need material for that (e.g. smart watch tracking your running workouts and progress)? Make a plan Based on all the information collected in the earlier stages it is possible to create a well-designed (training) plan. This plan not only focuses on the desired requirements and current performance level, but also tries to individualize this plan as much as possible for the specific athlete. Some factors that should be considered are available training time, training history, injury history, personal preferences, strength & weaknesses, training environment and available equipment. Establish methods... ...to regularly evaluate to what extent the plan is followed: Your goal is clear, you know what to work on and the training program has been made. Now it is absolutely crucial to ensure ways to track to what extent the plan is actually followed. Tracking the implementation of a plan is important for multiple reasons: Quality control Make Performance evaluation possible (see step 7) Identifying possible obstacles in the training process Learn more about the overall training process Establish methods ... ...to regularly evaluate the effectiveness of the plan: Besides evaluating how far the plan is followed, it is necessary to regularly evaluate if the current program is still suitable in chasing your goal. This is important for the following reasons: Creates constant alignment with your main goal Adapts to Changing Circumstances Identifies Emerging Opportunities Enhances Accountability Facilitates Learning and Improvement Adjust the plan when necessary Plans may need adjustments based on changing circumstances or unforeseen challenges. Even the best coaches cannot comprehend all the complexity in life. Regular monitoring allows for adaptability and flexibility in response to evolving situations, ensuring that the plan remains goal-based, relevant and achievable."

This physical connotation persisted through the medieval period, particularly in contexts related to battles, feats of athleticism, and demonstrations of force. Over time, the word began to encompass mental and emotional fortitude as well. Strength came to represent resilience, determination, and the ability to withstand challenges, adversity, or hardship. This broader interpretation of strength became especially pronounced during the Renaissance and the Age of Enlightenment when intellectual and moral strength gained prominence alongside physical prowess. Nowadays, the word strength can be used in multiple contexts: 1. Politics and statecraft In the realm of politics and statecraft, the term \"strength\" refers to the capability of a government, nation, or political entity to effectively wield power, influence, and authority both domestically and on the international stage. It can encompass dimensions like political strength, economic strength and military strength. 2. Materials In the context of materials, \"strength\" refers to the ability of a substance or component to withstand an applied force without breaking, yielding, or undergoing significant deformation. It is a critical mechanical property that indicates how well a material can resist external loads, stresses, or forces. Strength in materials is often categorized into several types like tensile strength or compressive strength. 3. Psychological trait From a psychological perspective, \"strength\" refers to the quality or state of being mentally resilient, possessing vigor, to endure challenges and withstand pressure or adversity. Psychological strength can manifest in various forms, including emotional resilience, intellectual fortitude, and moral courage. It is an attribute that contributes to an individual's overall capacity to navigate life's challenges with determination and effectiveness. 4. Physical strength In the context of physicality, \"strength\" specifically refers to the ability of an athlete to exert force with the goal to resist or overcome resistance. This makes it a critical component in various athletic disciplines. In sports science, strength is often assessed through measurements by measuring the maximum amount of force produced during a maximal voluntary isometric contraction. Another possible option could be with a one-repetition maximum (1RM). Chapter: What is the musculoskeletal system? The ability of humans (and a lot of other animals) to exert force is crucial for life. The production of force is induced by the muscles. However, the muscles are part of a complex system called the musculoskeletal system. This system consists of: Muscles are the contractile tissues that generate force, allowing movement and providing support to the body. Bones form the rigid framework of the body, offering support, protection to vital organs, and serving as attachment points for muscles. Joints are the connections between bones, facilitating movement and providing flexibility. Different types of joints allow various ranges of motion. Tendons are fibrous tissues that connect muscles to bones, transmitting the force generated by muscles to move the bones. Ligaments connect bones to other bones, providing stability to joints and preventing excessive movement. Thanks to these structures, the musculoskeletal system is crucial for the following functions:Postural Stability and Proprioception The human body constantly experiences gravitational forces, and maintaining an upright posture requires counteracting these forces through muscular effort. Muscles play a vital role in stabilizing the spine, pelvis, and other skeletal structures, preventing collapse and enabling an individual to stand and sit with balance. Additionally, the muscles also provide sensory feedback to the brain, aiding in the maintenance of balance and allowing individuals to navigate uneven terrain or adjust posture in response to external stimuli. Efficient Gait Walking and other forms of locomotion require the controlled exertion of force. Muscles propel the body forward, absorb shock during each step, and maintain stability throughout the gait cycle. The ability to exert force efficiently is essential for fluid and energy-conserving movement. Coordination and Movement Control The ability to exert force is integral to coordinated movement. Muscles contract and relax in a coordinated manner to produce controlled and purposeful motions. This is essential for activities ranging from simple tasks like reaching for an object to complex actions like playing a musical instrument or engaging in sports. In summary, the ability to exert force is integral to the biomechanics of the human body, supporting posture, movement, and overall functionality. It enables individuals to navigate the gravitational challenges of Earth, maintain stability, and engage in a wide range of physical activities essential for daily living. Upon delving deeper into the analysis of HYROX, it becomes evident that every activity within the event requires a degree of force production for successful completion. While the more overt exercises such as the Sled Push, Sled Pull, and Lunges explicitly demand force, even seemingly simple tasks, like staying upright during a run involve a certain level of force production. Chapter: Which physiological factors are important for strength? We already talked about the musculoskeletal system. In this section we want to learn you more about the physiological factors that play a crucial role in determining an individual's strength. Muscle Fiber Type Muscles consist of different fiber types, such as Type I (slow-twitch) and Type II (fast-twitch) fibers. Type II fibers, particularly Type IIb, are associated with higher force production and are crucial for explosive movements. Muscle Cross-Sectional Area The size of a muscle, often measured by its cross-sectional area, is a significant determinant of strength. Larger muscles generally have a greater capacity to produce force. Neuromuscular Efficiency The ability of the nervous system to recruit and activate motor units (groups of muscle fibers and the corresponding motor neuron) influences strength. Improved neuromuscular efficiency enhances the synchronization and coordination of muscle contractions. Muscle Architecture The arrangement of muscle fibers, such as pennation angle and muscle length, affects the force-generating capacity. Muscles with a greater pennation angle may have a higher force-producing potential. Biomechanics and Joint Angles The biomechanics of a joint and the angles at which muscles act influence strength. The length-tension relationship of muscles and optimal joint angles can impact force production. Tendon Stiffness Tendons connect muscles to bones and store elastic energy during movements. Greater tendon stiffness is associated with enhanced force transmission and can contribute to strength. Metabolic Factors Energy metabolism, including the capacity for ATP production, influences strength during both short bursts of intense activity and prolonged efforts. Efficient energy systems support sustained force production. Genetic Factors Genetic predispositions can influence muscle fiber composition, muscle size, and other physiological factors related to strength. However, training and environmental factors also play a significant role. Summary Understanding these physiological factors is essential for designing effective strength training programs and optimizing performance. Individual variability and the interplay of these factors contribute to the uniqueness of each person's strength profile. Chapter: What are the main adaptations when training for strength? Training for strength induces various physiological adaptations in the body, optimizing the neuromuscular system and enhancing the capacity to generate force. Here are some of the main physiological adaptations associated with strength training. Muscle Hypertrophy Strength training stimulates the growth of muscle fibers, a process known as hypertrophy. This increase in muscle size is primarily due to an enlargement of individual muscle fibers, leading to greater force production. Increased Motor Unit Recruitment The nervous system becomes more efficient at recruiting motor units, which consist of a motor neuron and the muscle fibers it innervates. This improved recruitment allows for more synchronized and forceful muscle contractions. Neuromuscular Coordination Strength training enhances neuromuscular coordination, improving the ability of the nervous system to coordinate the activation of multiple (different!) muscles for efficient and powerful movements. Muscle Fiber Type Adaptations Although limited, some strength training programs may induce shifts in muscle fiber types, favoring an increase in the size and force-generating capacity of fast-twitch (Type II) muscle fibers. Bone, Tendon and Ligament Strength Bone and connective tissues, such as tendons and ligaments, adapt to the increased load placed on them during strength training. This can increase bone density and improve the overall stability and integrity of joints. Increased Energy Storage and Utilization Strength training improves the energy storage capacity of muscles and enhances the efficiency of energy utilization during contractions, contributing to sustained force production. Enhanced Muscle Architecture Regular strength training may lead to changes in muscle architecture, such as an increase in pennation angle, which can impact force transmission and muscle function. Hormonal Changes Strength training influences hormonal responses, including increases in testosterone and growth hormone levels, which play roles in muscle protein synthesis and adaptation. Summary Individual responses to strength training can vary based on factors like genetics, training intensity, frequency, and volume. A well-designed strength training program considers these physiological adaptations, progressively challenging the body to promote continuous improvements in strength and performance. Chapter: Interviews --> 00:00:10.359 So welcome to this interview about strength. --> 00:00:12.839 Next to me I have Casper De Witt. --> 00:00:14.919 He works as a strength and conditioning coach --> 00:00:16.399 and also as a sports scientist --> 00:00:18.359 for the Olympic judo program. --> 00:00:21.359 But above all, he also competed in the HYROX once. --> 00:00:26.719 Casper, what is the role of strength in the judo program? --> 00:00:28.640 Thanks for inviting me here then. --> 00:00:30.559 It was nice doing the HYROX with you in Frankfurt. --> 00:00:31.960 Oh, with you, you were standing there --> 00:00:33.079 and I will finish much later. --> 00:00:38.600 To answer your question, strength for judo. --> 00:00:41.960 Well, you probably can imagine that it's quite useful --> 00:00:45.600 to be very powerful and strong, strong mostly, --> 00:00:48.600 if you wanna twist your opponent into a position --> 00:00:50.520 where you otherwise wouldn't be. --> 00:00:53.399 So you can do a technique where you can score a point --> 00:00:54.039 on the opponent. --> 00:00:56.240 So idea in judo is that you throw the opponent --> 00:00:57.560 on his back on the ground. --> 00:01:01.920 Judo is actually called \"The Soft Way\". --> 00:01:04.719 So you actually use the momentum of your opponent --> 00:01:07.599 against the opponent to do, --> 00:01:10.319 by doing good techniques and leveraging the opponent --> 00:01:11.480 over your own body. --> 00:01:12.920 So if you're really good at judo, --> 00:01:16.120 it should be pretty soft and smooth. --> 00:01:18.560 But obviously if you fight someone else --> 00:01:20.120 who's also really good and strong, --> 00:01:23.000 it becomes also a battle of force. --> 00:01:27.760 For that, for judo, it's really useful to be strong --> 00:01:31.719 and it's not only useful to strong to be strong. --> 00:01:35.719 It's, and I'm borrowing a saying that a coach told me, --> 00:01:37.920 and it's also very relevant for HYROX. --> 00:01:40.599 You gotta be strong to be able to let go. --> 00:01:44.040 So imagine I'm fighting you and you are really strong --> 00:01:45.760 and I am not so strong. --> 00:01:48.519 At some point to move him, --> 00:01:51.879 I have to expand like 90% of my maximum strength. --> 00:01:54.680 I'm only gonna be able to do that for maybe a minute. --> 00:01:57.920 And while I'm doing that, I am completely locked up. --> 00:02:02.120 Like pushing a really heavy sled, I'm very rigid. --> 00:02:04.040 The blood is not flowing. --> 00:02:08.199 So I get occlusion, I get the lactate buildup. --> 00:02:10.960 So if I'm really strong, I can well, --> 00:02:14.280 fight with him and move another object --> 00:02:16.800 without being completely tense myself. --> 00:02:19.840 So you have to be strong to be able to relax or let go. --> 00:02:20.960 - Really nice. --> 00:02:23.800 And how does that work into like the really, --> 00:02:25.639 the strength training sessions? --> 00:02:28.159 Do we have any practical examples --> 00:02:31.240 how you use strength training for the judo program? --> 00:02:34.120 - Well, always the answer is it depends. --> 00:02:35.960 But if you're speaking about the top level athletes, --> 00:02:41.879 the calendar with the tournaments in the year --> 00:02:42.879 it's much like HYROX. --> 00:02:45.240 Every three to six weeks, there's something on. --> 00:02:47.599 So the top level athletes, --> 00:02:49.080 they don't really have a lot of time --> 00:02:50.960 to do very dedicated strength blocks, --> 00:02:52.800 maybe once or twice for weeks. --> 00:02:55.879 So we've just tried to build it into the week, --> 00:02:58.439 but only short sessions, maybe one or two --> 00:03:02.520 focusing on the big movement patterns. --> 00:03:04.639 Because they're already at a --> 00:03:05.879 level where they're strong enough --> 00:03:07.719 or strength is not a limiting factor. --> 00:03:09.120 Now for the developing athletes, --> 00:03:12.400 those that we know should be much stronger --> 00:03:15.199 to be able to compete with their competitors --> 00:03:16.879 in their weight class. --> 00:03:21.039 So those that we know that still have a long ways to go, --> 00:03:22.919 we focus much less on competitions --> 00:03:26.159 and we are running more developmental programs with them, --> 00:03:29.599 where we just focus for maybe half a year on strength --> 00:03:31.520 and we send them to competitions --> 00:03:33.319 while not being optimally tapered. --> 00:03:37.439 And that way we put more of their energy --> 00:03:38.439 towards strength training --> 00:03:40.000 and building fundamental blocks. --> 00:03:42.520 So it depends on where you're at --> 00:03:45.080 and it depends on where you need to be in the future. --> 00:03:47.400 So if you're already strong enough, we just maintain. --> 00:03:51.159 And if you're not strong enough yet, then we build. --> 00:03:53.000 - Clear. --> 00:03:55.840 And now to make a little bit more connection with HYROX, --> 00:04:00.120 what would you say is the use of strength in HYROX? --> 00:04:02.120 Why do you need strength to compete in HYROX? --> 00:04:05.000 - It's nice to answer that question. --> 00:04:07.800 Because if you look at HYROX, and as I found out myself, --> 00:04:11.439 strength isn't really important in HYROX. --> 00:04:13.800 So it's an endurance event and you've got the eight runs --> 00:04:16.279 and you've got a ski and a row. --> 00:04:19.839 So that's already 10 of the 16 events --> 00:04:21.199 that are pure endurance based. --> 00:04:24.399 But what I did find is --> 00:04:30.600 if you push the sled and it's really light --> 00:04:34.000 because you're really strong, well, it's still fatiguing, --> 00:04:35.720 but it's not really fatiguing. --> 00:04:38.120 So again, about the be strong to let go, --> 00:04:40.839 I can kinda lean into the sled --> 00:04:43.399 and then just push it while giving 50% --> 00:04:45.959 and I can get a pretty decent pace that way. --> 00:04:49.839 So then I can, well, I'm not so quick on the row --> 00:04:53.680 but I save a bit of energy because I'm relatively strong. --> 00:04:56.079 So imagine now that you are not so strong --> 00:04:57.000 and you have to push the sled --> 00:04:58.879 and it takes you 80% of your power. --> 00:05:02.240 Yeah, then it becomes quite a difficult thing to do --> 00:05:04.040 and you're really tired when you have to run --> 00:05:05.040 and then your coordination --> 00:05:08.680 goes to, yeah, it really doesn't, --> 00:05:11.120 it's not so, the coordination goes to hell actually --> 00:05:13.040 and you run like a very clunky --> 00:05:14.560 and you lose your efficiency. --> 00:05:17.680 So that way the strength is not directly important --> 00:05:20.720 but it helps you get the things done efficiently. --> 00:05:27.120 Also, everybody knows that there's a difference --> 00:05:29.160 between the nine and the six kilo WallBalls. --> 00:05:31.959 I trained myself with 10 kilo WallBalls --> 00:05:34.120 because I thought I had to do nine kilo WallBalls. --> 00:05:36.720 And then if you find out that you have to do --> 00:05:38.519 a six kilo WallBall for a hundred reps, --> 00:05:39.839 that's really a relief. --> 00:05:43.439 So what I would say to the HYROX folk listening --> 00:05:46.920 to this is imagine that you become a bit stronger --> 00:05:50.720 after 10 weeks of training and you have the same idea --> 00:05:53.000 is that something that used to be, --> 00:05:56.040 that felt like a nine kilo wall ball now feels like a six, --> 00:06:00.040 something that felt like a pro category sled --> 00:06:01.759 now feels like an open category sled. --> 00:06:04.959 Just imagine the amount of speed and quickness --> 00:06:06.399 you were able to gain by doing that --> 00:06:07.839 and that will help you immensely. --> 00:06:10.399 Last thing I wanna say, last thing, --> 00:06:13.319 if you look at the strength numbers from the ELITE15, --> 00:06:16.199 I looked up an article from the Roxy Life. --> 00:06:17.240 - The Roxlife. --> 00:06:18.720 - The Roxlife, yeah. --> 00:06:22.879 - It's a bit older, so I think, but it's still relevant. --> 00:06:25.000 Like the strength numbers aren't that high. --> 00:06:29.800 I read like I wanted 123RM on the squad, 140 kilograms --> 00:06:34.319 deadlift, or you've got of course the number one guy, --> 00:06:35.120 what's his name? --> 00:06:35.800 Hunter McIntyre. --> 00:06:37.800 Yeah, he's an ex-crossfitter, so he's much stronger. --> 00:06:41.040 I don't think you need the squad 200, --> 00:06:44.000 but you need a decent strength level to do that. --> 00:06:47.240 So if your ambition is to make the ELITE15, --> 00:06:50.079 I think it would be wise to be somewhere in the vicinity --> 00:06:51.680 of these average numbers. --> 00:06:53.600 And you do need to train for that, --> 00:06:55.839 especially if you are more aerobically inclined. --> 00:06:59.519 And I think that brings us to your next question. --> 00:07:00.920 - Yeah, yeah, it definitely does --> 00:07:03.680 because when you are a coach --> 00:07:05.639 and you coach different athletes --> 00:07:08.920 or you are athletes yourself and you conclude for yourself, --> 00:07:10.600 okay, I lack in strength, --> 00:07:12.759 what will be your practical tips --> 00:07:14.680 in terms like exercises, --> 00:07:18.000 but also like what time of the week, yeah, --> 00:07:20.680 to make a plan for yourself to train that strength --> 00:07:22.120 and to improve your strength. --> 00:07:25.240 - I'm gonna answer these in reverse order, I guess. --> 00:07:27.959 So what exercises would you get stronger at? --> 00:07:29.279 Well, I think, for example, --> 00:07:31.800 the big bilateral movement, squats and hinges, --> 00:07:33.319 like deadlifting, Romanian deadlifts, --> 00:07:36.680 and also the unilateral variants are quite important --> 00:07:38.680 because you need to do a ton of unilateral stuff --> 00:07:40.879 in hardworks, like the lunges and the, well, --> 00:07:42.399 and running itself. --> 00:07:44.639 - Sled push, lunges. --> 00:07:47.240 - I would focus on, if you want to improve strength, --> 00:07:49.800 then do it in a maximal strength manner. --> 00:07:50.759 Like don't do 20 reps, --> 00:07:53.240 just focus on five to eight reps on those, --> 00:07:55.120 struggle a bit, get stronger. --> 00:07:57.000 Later on in your periodization, --> 00:07:58.319 this is something I know you do, --> 00:07:59.360 you can increase the reps --> 00:08:01.959 and immediately go into strength endurance --> 00:08:03.959 and that's periodization for you. --> 00:08:05.680 But first, you need to get a bit stronger. --> 00:08:08.600 The first question was, --> 00:08:13.040 what would my advice be if you decided --> 00:08:14.519 that you need to work on strength? --> 00:08:16.720 So you looked at other people --> 00:08:19.000 you think you can catch up to time-wise --> 00:08:21.120 and you identify, well, I need to do some strength. --> 00:08:25.360 First, I would probably get help from a HYROX coach --> 00:08:29.040 or someone else you know is capable in strength training, --> 00:08:31.639 just to have a look and maybe have a discussion with. --> 00:08:35.600 It always helps to piggyback off other people's experience. --> 00:08:41.000 What I would do, because HYROX is complex --> 00:08:42.679 in that you need to maintain --> 00:08:45.000 many qualities at the same time, --> 00:08:46.720 especially if you want to peak for a competition, --> 00:08:50.720 is you only have so much energy of recoverability --> 00:08:51.519 in the week. --> 00:08:54.279 So I think the answer is periodizing. --> 00:08:56.320 So if you do one or two maintenance --> 00:08:58.919 strength sessions a week, that's fine. --> 00:09:02.159 It's very easy to maintain maximal strength and power. --> 00:09:04.639 It's much more difficult to build it. --> 00:09:05.960 So if you want to build it, --> 00:09:09.600 I would advise a four to six, maybe eight week period --> 00:09:12.919 where you're gonna up the volume of strength training. --> 00:09:15.919 And then when you've done that, you're stronger --> 00:09:18.279 and then you're gonna back go maintain again. --> 00:09:19.120 Why? --> 00:09:20.879 Because if you do all things at once, --> 00:09:22.960 that's not really periodization. --> 00:09:25.080 And the strength training is something you do --> 00:09:28.159 for your HYROX is next year or later on in the year, --> 00:09:30.399 not something for your immediate HYROX --> 00:09:31.840 you're planning to do in a few weeks. --> 00:09:34.519 So I would, if you're going to do something, --> 00:09:36.240 then plan for it accordingly --> 00:09:37.919 and make sure you see it through. --> 00:09:40.360 Don't just do everything at once and hope for a miracle. --> 00:09:41.879 - Yeah, thanks. --> 00:09:45.279 So I think those are really valuable lessons. --> 00:09:46.720 So thanks for that Casper --> 00:09:48.519 and thanks for your time for being here. --> 00:09:51.960 Hopefully you enjoyed this short interview about strength --> 00:09:54.399 and yeah, thanks again. --> 00:09:57.120 And hopefully we see you at the next HYROX event. --> 00:09:57.360 - Sure. --> 00:09:58.879 I'm going to Rotterdam. --> 00:09:59.519 So see you there. --> 00:09:59.720 - Yeah."

The word \"coordination\" has its roots in the Latin language. It is derived from the Latin word \"coordinatio,\" which combines \"co-\" (meaning \"together\" or \"with\") and \"ordinatio\" (meaning \"arrangement\" or \"order\"). The Latin term reflects the core concept of bringing elements together in an organized and harmonious manner. Over time, as societies became more complex and interdependent, the need for effective collaboration and synchronization of activities became increasingly apparent. The term \"coordination\" emerged as a descriptor for the skill or process of organizing and harmonizing different elements to achieve a common goal. Today the term \"coordination\" has diverse applications across various fields, highlighting its importance in facilitating effective communication, movement, and collaboration in different aspects of life. Here are definitions in various contexts: 1. Teamwork, Collaboration, Organization and Management In teamwork and collaboration, coordination involves organizing and synchronizing the efforts of individuals or groups to achieve a common goal or optimal efficiency. 2. Physiology and Biology In physiology and biology, coordination refers to the integrated functioning of different organs, systems, or body parts to maintain homeostasis and perform physiological processes. 3. Grammar and Linguistics In grammar and linguistics, coordination refers to the linking of words, phrases, or clauses of equal grammatical rank in a sentence. 4. Physical Movement In the context of physical movement, coordination refers to the harmonious interaction of different body parts and muscle groups to perform smooth and effective actions or movements. This is also called motor coordination. Chapter: What are the different types of motor coordination? There are various types of motor coordination, each contributing to different aspects of physical activity and skill development. Here are some key types: Gross Motor Coordination Gross motor coordination involves the coordinated control of large muscle groups to perform activities such as walking, running, jumping, and other whole-body movements. Fine Motor Coordination Fine motor coordination involves the precise control of small muscle movements, usually in the hands and fingers, to perform tasks that require dexterity and precision. Eye-Hand Coordination Eye-hand coordination is the ability to use visual information to guide and control hand movements accurately. Hand-Eye-Body Coordination Hand-eye-body coordination involves the integration of visual information with both hand and body movements. Playing sports like tennis or basketball, where one needs to track the ball visually, position the body correctly, and coordinate hand movements to interact with the object. Sensory-Motor Coordination Sensory-motor coordination involves the integration of sensory information (such as proprioception) with motor responses for balanced and coordinated movement. An example of this could be maintaining balance while walking on an uneven surface. Temporal Coordination Temporal coordination involves timing and sequencing movements in a rhythmic and coordinated manner. Developing these different types of motor coordination is essential for overall physical competence and the performance of various activities in daily life, sports, and other skill-based tasks. For a lot of sports, including HYROX, it is crucial to master different types of motor coordination. Examples of this can be the use of gross motor coordination to perform activities like running, SkiErg, Burpees, Rowing and the Farmers Carry. Another example could be Hand-Eye-Body coordination to correctly handle the rope during the Sled Pull and to correctly execute the Wall Balls. Chapter: How does motor coordination develop over time? Infancy and Early Childhood In the early stages, infants exhibit reflexive movements that are involuntary responses to stimuli. Over time, these reflexes become more controlled and purposeful. Gradually they develop gross motor skills, such as rolling over, sitting, crawling, and eventually walking, as they gain strength and stability. Preschool and Early School Years During these years fine motor skills develop during activities like drawing, coloring, and using small objects. Additionally, the ability to use both sides of the body in a coordinated manner improves, supporting activities like climbing, running, and throwing. Middle Childhood Hand-eye coordination becomes more refined, allowing for improved skills in catching and throwing, as well as engaging in sports and recreational activities. Also the integration of sensory information with motor responses continues to improve, contributing to better balance and body awareness. Adolescence Adolescents experience fine-tuning of motor skills, including those related to sports, arts, and other specialized activities. Furthermore, timing and sequencing of movements become more precise, facilitating activities such as dance, music, and sports performance. Adulthood Continued practice and engagement in specific activities lead to the refinement of specialized motor skills. Individuals become proficient in activities they regularly perform. Adults also develop strategies to compensate for any declines in physical abilities, adjusting their movements to maintain efficiency and reduce the risk of injury. Lifelong Learning and Adaptation Throughout life, the brain retains its ability to adapt and reorganize neural pathways, a concept known as neuroplasticity. Learning new skills and engaging in diverse activities can stimulate neuroplastic changes that enhance coordination. Regular physical activity, sports participation, and engagement in activities that challenge coordination contribute to maintaining and improving coordination. Chapter: Interview --> 00:00:09.079 I'd like to introduce to you --> 00:00:11.199 Michael Groen, the one and only. --> 00:00:13.719 Michael, you're a strength and --> 00:00:16.400 conditioning coach here at Papendal for various sports --> 00:00:18.480 like archery and also volleyball. --> 00:00:19.199 Yes. --> 00:00:21.760 Can you tell us something more about the role of --> 00:00:23.280 coordination in those sports? --> 00:00:24.119 Yeah, of course. --> 00:00:26.599 I think coordination is a part of all sports, --> 00:00:29.159 so not discriminating to any sport at all. --> 00:00:31.159 But there's a big difference --> 00:00:33.920 between playing volleyball or archery. --> 00:00:35.639 So if you're looking at archery, it's a --> 00:00:38.800 fine motor skill that's really difficult if --> 00:00:40.519 you shoot something at 70 meters and --> 00:00:42.280 there's wind and that kind of stuff. --> 00:00:43.320 And one millimeter is a --> 00:00:45.440 changeable thing between a 10 or a 9. --> 00:00:50.360 Or hitting a ball over a net and get it into the field. --> 00:00:54.079 So that's, I think, there's a pretty big --> 00:00:55.599 difference in coordination between that. --> 00:00:57.880 And how do you work with --> 00:01:00.199 coordination into your own strength and --> 00:01:01.239 conditioning programs? --> 00:01:03.199 Normally I work together with coaches. --> 00:01:07.400 So sometimes the coaches, we talk about it like, --> 00:01:10.880 this time I can ask some extra --> 00:01:12.679 energy from them in my strength and --> 00:01:13.559 conditioning training. --> 00:01:15.079 So they have to do the skill and the --> 00:01:17.719 suboptimal conditions into their own --> 00:01:18.880 training part. --> 00:01:21.119 And sometimes we do it otherwise, --> 00:01:22.559 so they have the skill training and --> 00:01:23.400 their optimal conditions. --> 00:01:27.320 And then I can do my stuff with them to make them tired and --> 00:01:28.440 stronger and that kind of stuff. --> 00:01:31.320 And then we work two works to make it more complex. --> 00:01:34.760 So we did something with archery, --> 00:01:37.719 not something hidden or something. --> 00:01:39.880 It was kind of a both. --> 00:01:42.559 So you get tired, you have to do the skill under --> 00:01:46.559 suboptimal conditions, to get them used to --> 00:01:48.960 how do I shoot the arrow while I'm tired? --> 00:01:50.320 How do I shoot the arrow while I'm --> 00:01:54.079 disturbed by my fine motor unit skills? --> 00:01:58.280 That kind of stuff for archery, we --> 00:01:59.920 try that to make it most complex and --> 00:02:01.559 try to train their coordination --> 00:02:04.119 under suboptimal conditions to make them --> 00:02:06.039 efficient in the skills they have --> 00:02:08.760 to do under high pressure situations. --> 00:02:10.440 Yeah, really cool. --> 00:02:12.239 And you already mentioned that --> 00:02:14.679 coordination is a part of any sport. --> 00:02:16.920 So let's talk a little bit more about HYROX. --> 00:02:19.400 I talked to you about HYROX. --> 00:02:20.239 Yeah, exactly. You know what it is. --> 00:02:23.079 What would you say is the role --> 00:02:24.800 of coordination in HYROX and --> 00:02:26.280 how would an athlete that maybe --> 00:02:30.360 lacks coordination, how would that view --> 00:02:32.159 themselves in the sport, how would --> 00:02:34.119 that express themselves in the sport? --> 00:02:39.400 If I look at HYROX, I think the most big --> 00:02:40.960 picture I can imagine was the WallBall. --> 00:02:41.880 A no-rep. --> 00:02:43.599 If you get a no-rep with WallBall, --> 00:02:45.679 it's a loss of energy and loss of time. --> 00:02:47.079 So that's two loosing points. --> 00:02:50.239 So in my opinion, if you have the --> 00:02:53.159 movements of SkiErg, Walking Lunges, --> 00:02:56.119 pushing some weights, then you have to look --> 00:02:58.239 at, can I do it under optimal conditions? --> 00:03:00.159 I'm really good at it. --> 00:03:00.800 Nice. --> 00:03:02.519 Make it harder for yourself. --> 00:03:04.239 Can you do it in suboptimal conditions? --> 00:03:04.880 Like a WallBall --> 00:03:07.000 can you do it when you did a two-kilometer run? --> 00:03:09.559 Can you still hit the WallBalls all --> 00:03:11.639 the time, without no-reps, and make it work? --> 00:03:13.840 Or do you get a lack of efficiency? --> 00:03:15.760 You get no-reps. --> 00:03:19.960 Make sure you practice it under suboptimal conditions so --> 00:03:21.320 you know where your flaws are --> 00:03:23.000 and you can work on that in optimal --> 00:03:25.519 conditions and get back to suboptimal conditions --> 00:03:28.800 and make it worse, worse, worse until you can train --> 00:03:30.079 yourself in the horrible conditions --> 00:03:31.599 and make it work still. --> 00:03:33.360 And that's what we call skill and drills. --> 00:03:37.800 And if you make that a little bit more practical, like how --> 00:03:40.360 do you maybe practice a WallBall --> 00:03:41.719 under suboptimal conditions? --> 00:03:42.880 You already mentioned something --> 00:03:44.760 about doing a 2K run in front of it. --> 00:03:46.679 Do you have any other practical tips for that? --> 00:03:47.760 Yeah, do a SkiErg. --> 00:03:49.079 You have to SkiErg as well. --> 00:03:50.280 Make your arms tired. --> 00:03:52.039 Can you still hit the movement? --> 00:03:53.519 Can you still make the reps? --> 00:03:57.800 Make sure you are driving from your --> 00:03:59.719 heels and driving from your legs in case of --> 00:04:01.440 maybe you do it all from your arms. --> 00:04:04.440 Then you can discriminate all the parts you have to use and --> 00:04:05.599 you can see your own movements --> 00:04:08.760 and the less efficient things in your movement. --> 00:04:10.360 And make that your strong movement. --> 00:04:15.320 So you always have a solution when things happen. --> 00:04:16.239 I want to say something different. --> 00:04:19.719 If things happen and it doesn't go your way, you always --> 00:04:20.760 have a solution in your backpack --> 00:04:24.559 to keep them going, keep them working because you know --> 00:04:26.159 what's efficient for you in the suboptimal --> 00:04:28.719 conditions and you can make it work for you again. --> 00:04:29.599 Awesome. --> 00:04:31.400 So, yeah, that was it. --> 00:04:32.840 Thanks very much for your time. --> 00:04:36.119 And our audience appreciates this interview. --> 00:04:36.920 I hope so. --> 00:04:37.760 Thank you."

The word \"endurance\" has its origin in the Latin word \"indurare,\" meaning \"to harden\" or \"make hard.\" Over time, the term evolved, and its meaning expanded to encompass the ability to withstand or sustain prolonged and challenging efforts. The concept of endurance has deep roots in human history, reflecting the necessity for physical resilience in various activities, from hunting and gathering to warfare. Early civilizations recognized the importance of enduring physical hardships, and this notion was embedded in cultural practices and warrior training. During the Renaissance, the understanding of endurance started to transition from a purely physical attribute to include mental and emotional components. In the 20th century, endurance training became a focal point in athletic conditioning. Coaches and athletes began to employ systematic and scientific approaches to enhance their stamina and improve performance. Endurance evolved into a specialized category, with disciplines like marathon running, triathlons, and endurance cycling gaining prominence. Nowadays, the broad definition of the word \"endurance\" refers to the ability to sustain or withstand prolonged, challenging, or adverse conditions. It encompasses the capacity to endure physical, mental, or emotional stress, demonstrating resilience and persistence over time. In the context of sports and physical fitness, \"endurance\" specifically refers to the athlete's ability to perform sustained, aerobic activities for an extended period without experiencing excessive fatigue. It involves the efficiency of cardiovascular and respiratory systems, as well as the muscles' capacity to endure repetitive and prolonged efforts. In both contexts, endurance is a multifaceted concept that involves physiological, psychological, and sometimes even emotional factors. Physiologically, it relates to the efficiency of energy production, oxygen utilization, and the body's ability to remove waste products. Psychologically, it involves mental toughness, focus, and the capacity to push through discomfort. Endurance is a key component of overall fitness and plays a vital role in determining an individual's or athlete's ability to perform well in various activities, whether they are everyday tasks or specific athletic endeavors. Making the link with endurance and HYROX is easy. To complete a HYROX you need to execute a lot of different exercises and activities. Especially for the athletes aiming for a podium spot or a certain time it does not allow for much (if any) rest during the whole race. Even the fastest athletes in the world take almost an hour to complete this race. Since an activity longer than 3 minutes is seen as an ‘endurance’ activity in sport science, it is safe to say that endurance is a crucial factor in HYROX. Chapter: What are human energy systems? There are different ways humans can provide themselves with the necessary energy to be physically active. These energy systems dynamically contribute to our energy needs, adapting to the intensity and duration of the activity at hand. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is a molecule often referred to as the \"energy currency\" of cells. It plays a critical role in cellular processes, including muscle contractions, nerve impulses, and the synthesis of essential molecules. The release of energy from ATP occurs when it is hydrolyzed to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and inorganic phosphate, providing the immediate and necessary energy for cellular functions. The three primary energy systems that produce ATP are: ATP-PC System (Anaerobic Alactic) The ATP-PC system is the immediate source of energy for short, high-intensity activities lasting up to 10 seconds. It operates without the need for oxygen, making it anaerobic. This system relies on stored adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and phosphocreatine (PC). ATP is the primary energy currency of cells, and PC helps rapidly regenerate ATP. Activities such as a maximal sprint or a single, powerful lift heavily tap into the ATP-PC system. While highly effective for immediate energy needs, this system has limited endurance and is quickly depleted. Glycolytic System (Anaerobic Lactic) The glycolytic system is the primary energy system for activities lasting from 10 seconds to about 2 minutes, emphasizing high-intensity efforts. It operates anaerobically, meaning without the presence of oxygen. Glycolysis is the process through which stored carbohydrates, in the form of glycogen, are broken down to produce ATP. While glycolysis provides a rapid energy supply, it also produces lactic acid as a byproduct. Accumulation of lactic acid, in combination with other metabolites, can lead to muscle fatigue and a decrease in performance. This system is heavily involved in activities such as 400-meter sprints, intense weightlifting, or activities requiring repeated bursts of energy. Aerobic System (Oxidative System) The aerobic system is the dominant energy system for prolonged, low to moderate-intensity activities lasting beyond 2 minutes. Unlike the anaerobic systems, the aerobic system relies on the presence of oxygen to efficiently produce ATP. Aerobic metabolism occurs in the mitochondria of cells and involves the breakdown of carbohydrates, fats, and, eventually, proteins. This system is highly efficient and provides a sustained supply of energy, making it crucial for activities like jogging, cycling, or any sustained endurance effort. While the aerobic system takes longer to generate ATP compared to the anaerobic systems, it has a significantly greater capacity for endurance. During an effort these systems do not work in isolation but rather in concert, with the body dynamically shifting reliance based on the demands of the activity. For instance, a sprinter may heavily rely on the ATP-PC and glycolytic systems, while a long-distance runner primarily utilizes the aerobic system. Effective training considers the specificity of these energy systems, aiming to optimize their efficiency and transition to meet the diverse demands of different sports and activities. Chapter: Which physiological factors are important for endurance? Respiration (the lungs) Efficient respiration ensures that oxygen can move into the blood, while efficiently removing carbon dioxide, a byproduct of energy production. Improved respiratory capacity enhances an athlete's ability to maintain optimal oxygen levels, delaying the onset of fatigue and promoting sustained performance. Central circulation (heart and blood vessels) Central circulation is vital for endurance as it ensures efficient oxygen and nutrient delivery to working muscles during sustained physical activity. The heart pumps oxygenated blood through the vessels, to the working muscles. Additionally, efficient central circulation assists in the removal of metabolic byproducts, such as carbon dioxide, aiding in sustained performance. An athlete with a well-conditioned central circulation benefits from optimized nutrient delivery, improved endurance, and enhanced recovery, emphasizing the integral role of cardiovascular health in achieving and sustaining peak athletic performance. Peripheral circulation (blood vessels close to the working muscles) Peripheral circulation is crucial for endurance as it ensures effective oxygen delivery and nutrient supply to active muscles during prolonged physical activity. Improved peripheral circulation enhances the capillary network within muscles, increasing the efficiency of nutrient exchange. Additionally, efficient peripheral circulation contributes to temperature regulation, preventing overheating during extended exertion Muscle metabolism (the muscles itself) Muscle metabolism refers to the chemical processes that occur within muscle cells to produce energy and maintain cellular functions. These processes involve the conversion of nutrients, primarily carbohydrates and fats, into energy that the muscles can use for various activities, including contraction and movement. During endurance efforts this process requires oxygen to create ATP. Hence, muscle metabolism is crucial for endurance as it dictates how efficiently the body produces and utilizes energy during prolonged physical activity. Central Drive (the brain) The brain plays a central and complex role during endurance efforts, influencing various physiological and psychological factors that contribute to an athlete's performance. Several key aspects highlight the brain's involvement in endurance activities: Pacing and Strategy: The brain is crucial in determining pacing strategies during endurance efforts. Athletes need to make conscious decisions about their effort distribution, considering factors like terrain, environmental conditions, and the overall duration of the activity. Motivation and Mental Toughness: Endurance activities often require mental resilience and motivation to push through discomfort and fatigue. The brain's role in maintaining focus, positive mindset, and mental toughness is crucial for enduring prolonged physical exertion. Regulation of Body Temperature: The brain is involved in thermoregulation, ensuring the body maintains a stable temperature during exercise. This becomes particularly important in endurance activities where sustained effort can generate significant heat. The brain signals mechanisms like sweating and blood vessel dilation to dissipate heat and prevent overheating. Neuromuscular Coordination: The brain coordinates neuromuscular activity, ensuring efficient movement patterns and muscle recruitment during endurance activities. This optimization helps conserve energy and prevent premature muscle fatigue. Fuel Utilization: The brain monitors fuel availability, including glycogen and fat stores, and adjusts energy substrate utilization during endurance activities. Chapter: What are the main adaptations when training for endurance? Training for endurance induces several physiological adaptations, optimizing its efficiency to meet the increased oxygen demands associated with prolonged physical activity. Some of the key adaptations include: Respiration (the lungs) Increased Lung Capacity: Allowing individuals to take in larger volumes of air with each breath. This is often achieved through enhanced lung compliance and improved respiratory muscle strength. Improved Oxygen Diffusion: The efficiency of oxygen diffusion across the lung's alveoli and into the bloodstream is enhanced with endurance training. This ensures a more effective transfer of oxygen from the lungs to the blood for transportation to working muscles. Enhanced Respiratory Muscle Endurance: Endurance training strengthens the respiratory muscles, such as the diaphragm and intercostal muscles, contributing to sustained breathing efficiency. Central circulation (heart and blood vessels) Increased Stroke Volume and Cardiac Output: Endurance training often leads to an increase in stroke volume, the amount of blood ejected by the heart with each beat. This adaptation enables the heart to pump a larger volume of blood per contraction, enhancing the overall amount of blood pumped per minute (cardiac output). Improved Ventricular Compliance: Endurance training may improve the compliance of the heart's ventricles, allowing them to fill more effectively during the diastolic phase. This adaptation contributes to increased stroke volume and cardiac output. Optimized Blood Volume: Endurance training can lead to an expansion of blood volume, enhancing the overall circulating fluid available for oxygen transport and nutrient delivery. This adaptation contributes to improved cardiovascular function and endurance. Peripheral circulation (blood vessels close to the working muscles) Improved Thermoregulation: Endurance activities often generate heat, and improved peripheral circulation aids in thermoregulation. Increased blood flow to the skin assists in dissipating heat through sweating, preventing overheating during prolonged exertion. Enhanced Oxygen Extraction: With endurance training, muscles become more proficient at extracting oxygen from the blood, even in conditions of increased demand. This adaptation improves the efficiency of oxygen utilization by active tissues during prolonged exercise. Improved Blood Flow Regulation: The body adapts to endurance training by becoming more efficient in regulating blood flow. The dilation of blood vessels (vasodilation) in response to increased demand is enhanced, ensuring that more oxygen-rich blood reaches working muscles. Enhanced Capillarization: The development of a denser capillary network in working muscles is a common adaptation to endurance training. This increased capillarization improves blood flow to active tissues, facilitating efficient nutrient exchange and oxygen delivery. Muscle metabolism (the muscles itself) Increased Mitochondrial Density: Mitochondria are the cellular structures responsible for aerobic (with oxygen) energy production. Endurance training stimulates the proliferation of mitochondria within muscle cells, improving the muscle's capacity to generate energy through aerobic metabolism. Enhanced Oxidative Enzyme Activity: Endurance training leads to increased activity of oxidative enzymes, which play essential roles in the aerobic breakdown of fuels (carbohydrates and fats) for energy. Improved Glycogen Storage and Utilization: While endurance training enhances reliance on fats, it also improves the storage and utilization of glycogen, particularly in muscle tissues. This ensures a balanced and efficient use of both carbohydrate and fat energy sources during prolonged exercise. Central Drive (the brain) Increased Neurotransmitter Release: Endurance training can enhance the release of neurotransmitters, such as serotonin and dopamine, in the brain. These chemicals contribute to mood regulation, mental well-being, and can help alleviate stress and anxiety during endurance activities. Neuroplasticity: Endurance training has been associated with increased neuroplasticity, which refers to the brain's ability to reorganize and adapt its structure in response to experiences. This may lead to improved motor control, coordination, and cognitive function, enhancing overall performance. Optimized Pacing Strategies: Endurance training improves an athlete's ability to develop and adhere to effective pacing strategies. The brain plays a crucial role in making decisions about when to conserve energy, increase effort, or maintain a steady pace during long-duration activities. Mental Toughness: Endurance training contributes to the development of mental toughness—the ability to persist in the face of challenges. This psychological resilience is essential for overcoming mental fatigue and pushing through the physical discomfort associated with endurance efforts. Chapter: Interview --> 00:00:08.880 So welcome to the next interview. --> 00:00:11.320 Next to me I have Gijs van Hofwegen. --> 00:00:13.759 He also works as a strength and conditioning coach --> 00:00:14.480 for team NL. --> 00:00:17.600 Gijs, we're gonna talk about endurance. --> 00:00:20.519 So what is the role of endurance in the sport --> 00:00:21.199 that you coach? --> 00:00:24.320 - I've multiple sports that I coach, --> 00:00:28.760 but for now the main focus for this interview is for Judo. --> 00:00:32.679 Endurance within Judo has actually a big part. --> 00:00:35.240 A lot of people think it's a strength or a power sport, --> 00:00:38.679 but it's also for a big part, aerobic. --> 00:00:41.200 This mainly has to do with --> 00:00:42.560 the, for instance, the match time. --> 00:00:47.079 Takes up to four minutes, and in those four minutes --> 00:00:49.200 you have to beat your opponent by throwing them, --> 00:00:51.920 by submitting them, giving them penalties. --> 00:00:54.479 And like you've written in the course, --> 00:00:57.920 it's everything longer than three minutes --> 00:00:59.880 can be seen as aerobic work. --> 00:01:03.759 So also within Judo, it's quite a big part, aerobically. --> 00:01:07.439 Even more, when there isn't a score --> 00:01:09.719 within the official four minutes, --> 00:01:13.840 it's a golden score, and that can last as long as needed --> 00:01:17.280 for one of the two Judo caster score points. --> 00:01:22.280 So yes, there's a big aerobic part in the sport. --> 00:01:25.920 - And how do you work that aerobic part --> 00:01:27.599 into your SNC program? --> 00:01:32.319 - The fundamental part is we let the sports --> 00:01:33.560 do the most of it. --> 00:01:35.799 Also within the training sessions, --> 00:01:39.359 the judokas could rely for quite a large amount --> 00:01:41.439 on their aerobic capacity. --> 00:01:44.519 Let's say when a training --> 00:01:46.439 session lasts for well over an hour, --> 00:01:50.239 it can't be all, be anaerobically. --> 00:01:53.920 So the longer it takes, the more they use their --> 00:01:56.439 anaerobic, sorry, their aerobic system. --> 00:01:59.959 So only if it's really needed, --> 00:02:03.560 if athletes are lagging endurance, --> 00:02:06.799 I program it within my sessions. --> 00:02:11.120 And how I do that is mostly low intensity work. --> 00:02:14.879 So for people using a heart rate strap, --> 00:02:16.800 it's the zone two, three work. --> 00:02:22.319 And if we convert that to percentage of max heart rate, --> 00:02:24.039 it's somewhere between 60 and 80%. --> 00:02:27.319 So the lower intensity work, --> 00:02:30.680 because the higher intensity work, the anaerobic side, --> 00:02:34.560 they get that largely also from their sport. --> 00:02:36.560 So that's how I program it. --> 00:02:40.199 And then I try to use one to two sessions --> 00:02:43.800 lasting 30 to 60 minutes each. --> 00:02:49.680 We try to fit that within our overall training program --> 00:02:50.240 for the week. --> 00:02:51.039 - Yeah, nice. --> 00:02:54.520 So, and when we make now more the connection to HYROX, --> 00:02:57.319 so yeah, I talked to you a lot about HYROX. --> 00:02:59.759 So you know what the race is. --> 00:03:03.879 Yeah, the role of endurance seems very obvious, --> 00:03:05.879 but still what is the role for you --> 00:03:09.000 when you think about it of endurance in HYROX? --> 00:03:14.400 - Yeah, like I said, Judo takes four minutes --> 00:03:19.039 when it's within the official match time. --> 00:03:21.159 And otherwise it can take even longer. --> 00:03:25.439 HYROX last up until an hour, as you told me. --> 00:03:29.319 So that's quite obvious that the aerobic part --> 00:03:32.800 is even larger than within Judo. --> 00:03:36.960 So it's very important to train that side. --> 00:03:42.520 And the tips and tricks I have --> 00:03:44.759 for the people who are participating in HYROX --> 00:03:48.719 or planning to do so is try to --> 00:03:49.800 implement it in your training --> 00:03:54.599 and work on the modalities that also can be found --> 00:03:58.960 in the competitions and in the trainings. --> 00:04:02.400 It's like rowing, skiing, running, --> 00:04:05.000 but also even the strength exercises, --> 00:04:08.680 like the WallBalls, the lunges, --> 00:04:11.319 the sled pulling and pushing. --> 00:04:13.960 So work on that. --> 00:04:17.560 And even so the technique is really important. --> 00:04:19.959 If your technique gets better, --> 00:04:21.560 like for instance, say rowing, --> 00:04:25.519 you get more efficient and better efficiency --> 00:04:27.319 means less fatigue. --> 00:04:31.439 So it takes less energy to perform a task. --> 00:04:34.399 So that also helps, so also work on your technique. --> 00:04:37.839 So that would be my advice. --> 00:04:40.720 - Yeah, so and how would you maybe do that --> 00:04:43.600 like in a training week and also with like --> 00:04:45.240 the other workouts in a week? --> 00:04:47.519 Are there any tips that you can think of --> 00:04:49.160 to structure that in a week? --> 00:04:50.480 - Yes. --> 00:04:56.120 I would say just like I do with my judo athletes, --> 00:05:01.839 I let them do separate conditioning sessions if necessary. --> 00:05:06.240 I would do the same here, like for instance, say, --> 00:05:09.519 start with two conditioning sessions, low intensity, --> 00:05:13.079 so between the 60, 80% of heart rate, --> 00:05:15.160 start with two times a week, 40 minutes, --> 00:05:17.120 see where it fits in your agenda, --> 00:05:18.959 but try to stick with the same moments --> 00:05:21.519 so you can get some consistency in your training. --> 00:05:25.040 Start with two times 40 minutes, --> 00:05:28.240 week later try to build up the volume, --> 00:05:32.040 two times 45, two times 50, et cetera. --> 00:05:35.720 And then let's say work to two times 60 minutes per week. --> 00:05:39.120 If you manage that, go back to the two times 40, --> 00:05:41.279 but try to pick up the pace a little bit. --> 00:05:43.720 So get the intensity a little bit higher --> 00:05:46.720 and then try to work back up to the 60 minutes. --> 00:05:49.600 So I would say that's my advice. --> 00:05:50.839 - Yeah, sounds really logical. --> 00:05:53.079 So thanks for this interview. --> 00:05:54.600 That's the end of the part about endurance. --> 00:05:57.199 Thanks, Gijs, for your time over here --> 00:05:59.879 and hopefully you enjoyed this interview --> 00:06:01.720 and we will go to the next module."

It involves studying the acute responses and chronic adaptations of various physiological systems to exercise. These systems include the cardiovascular, respiratory, muscular, and endocrine systems. Definition: Exercise physiology is the scientific study of how exercise affects the functions of the body, both immediately during exercise and in the long term as a result of training adaptations. Why Understanding Exercise Physiology is Crucial for HYROX coaches Why is it important for us as HYROX Performance Professionals to study exercise physiology? Understanding how the body works during exercise helps optimize performance, improve health, and prevent injury. It also provides insights into how regular physical activity can enhance the quality of life of our clients or athletes and reduce the risk of chronic diseases. Example: Consider a marathon runner and a weightlifter. Both athletes engage in vastly different types of physical activity, yet their training and performance rely on the principles of exercise physiology. By studying these principles, we can understand how their bodies adapt to endurance versus strength training, allowing for tailored training programs that maximize performance and minimize injury. To grasp the breadth of exercise physiology, we must delve into several key concepts, including energy systems muscle function cardiovascular dynamics respiratory adaptations. Chapter: Energy Systems: How does the body generate energy for exercise? The body relies on three primary energy systems to fuel physical activity: the phosphagen system, glycolysis, and oxidative phosphorylation. Each system plays a unique role in energy production, depending on the exercise's intensity and duration. In the context of HYROX competitions, understanding these energy systems is crucial for optimizing performance. Phosphagen system The phosphagen system is the body's immediate source of energy and is essential for the short, high-intensity activities characteristic of HYROX, such as the sled push and sled pull. This system relies on stored adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and creatine phosphate (CP) in the muscles. ATP provides immediate energy, but its stores are limited and can only sustain activity for a few seconds. Creatine phosphate helps regenerate ATP quickly, but this too is short-lived, lasting only about 10 seconds. Therefore, the phosphagen system is predominant in activities requiring quick bursts of energy, crucial for the explosive movements in HYROX events. Glycolysis When the duration of activity extends beyond what the phosphagen system can support, the body shifts to glycolysis for energy production. Glycolysis involves the breakdown of carbohydrates, primarily glucose, into pyruvate, producing ATP in the process. This system can provide energy for moderate-duration activities, typically lasting from about 10 seconds to 2 minutes, such as the rowing and wall balls segments of HYROX. Glycolysis can function both aerobically (with oxygen) and anaerobically (without oxygen). Anaerobic glycolysis, which occurs when oxygen is limited, produces lactate as a byproduct, leading to muscle fatigue. However, during aerobic glycolysis, pyruvate enters the mitochondria and is further processed for more sustained energy production. Oxidative phosphorylation For prolonged, low-intensity activities, the body relies on oxidative phosphorylation, also known as aerobic metabolism. This system uses oxygen to convert carbohydrates, fats, and sometimes proteins into ATP. Aerobic metabolism occurs in the mitochondria and is highly efficient, capable of sustaining energy production for extended periods, such as during the running segments of HYROX competitions. While this system produces a large amount of ATP, it is slower compared to the phosphagen system and glycolysis. The reliance on aerobic pathways allows for sustained muscle contractions over longer durations without the rapid onset of fatigue. Understanding these energy systems is crucial for HYROX athletes and coaches to optimize training and performance. Each system's contribution varies based on the specific demands of the HYROX workouts, and training can be tailored to enhance the efficiency and capacity of these energy systems. For instance, athletes might focus on improving their phosphagen system through high-intensity interval training (HIIT) for explosive power, glycolytic capacity for moderate-duration efforts, and oxidative phosphorylation for overall endurance. Through targeted training, HYROX athletes can improve their performance and delay the onset of fatigue by effectively utilizing the appropriate energy system for each segment of the competition. In conclusion, the integration of the phosphagen system, glycolysis, and oxidative phosphorylation in a well-rounded training regimen is essential for HYROX athletes. By understanding and leveraging these energy systems, athletes can enhance their performance, improve efficiency, and achieve success in the demanding and multifaceted events of HYROX competitions. Chapter: Muscle Function: How do muscles contract to produce movement? Muscle contraction is a complex process involving the interaction between actin and myosin filaments within muscle fibers. This process is regulated by the nervous system and fueled by adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Understanding how muscle contraction works is fundamental for optimizing performance in HYROX competitions, where muscle strength and endurance are crucial. Mechanism of Muscle Contraction Sliding Filament Theory At the heart of muscle contraction is the sliding filament theory, which describes how actin (thin) and myosin (thick) filaments slide past each other to shorten the muscle fiber. This process begins with a signal from the nervous system. Role of the Nervous System Muscle contraction starts with an action potential generated in the motor cortex of the brain. This signal travels down the spinal cord and through motor neurons to the neuromuscular junction, where the nerve meets the muscle fiber. Here, the neurotransmitter acetylcholine is released, which binds to receptors on the muscle fiber's membrane, triggering an action potential in the muscle. Calcium Release The action potential travels along the muscle fiber's membrane and into the T-tubules, reaching the sarcoplasmic reticulum. This organelle releases calcium ions (Ca2+), which bind to troponin, a regulatory protein on the actin filaments. The binding of calcium to troponin causes a conformational change that moves tropomyosin, another regulatory protein, away from the binding sites on actin. Cross-Bridge Cycle With the binding sites on actin exposed, the myosin heads, which are part of the thick filaments, attach to these sites, forming cross-bridges. Each myosin head has an ATP molecule bound to it, which is hydrolyzed to ADP and inorganic phosphate (Pi), providing the energy needed for the myosin head to pivot and pull the actin filament inward, shortening the muscle fiber. This is known as the power stroke. After the power stroke, a new ATP molecule binds to the myosin head, causing it to release the actin and return to its original position, ready to bind again. ATP's Role ATP is crucial for both the contraction and relaxation of muscles. During the power stroke, ATP is hydrolyzed to provide energy. For the myosin head to detach from actin, a new ATP molecule must bind to it. Without sufficient ATP, muscles would remain in a contracted state, leading to conditions such as rigor mortis. Application in HYROX Training In HYROX competitions, where events combine running with functional exercises like sled pushes, rowing, and wall balls, understanding muscle contraction can enhance training effectiveness. Each HYROX event requires different muscle groups to contract repeatedly and efficiently. Therefore, training should focus on improving the strength, endurance, and recovery of these muscles. Strength Training Strength training enhances the efficiency and power of muscle contractions by increasing muscle fiber size and neuromuscular coordination. Exercises such as squats, deadlifts, and bench presses can help HYROX athletes develop the necessary muscle strength for the high-intensity, short-duration efforts required in many HYROX events. Endurance Training Muscular endurance is vital for sustaining performance throughout the multiple events in a HYROX competition. Endurance training involves repeated, prolonged muscle contractions and can be achieved through activities such as circuit training, high-repetition weightlifting, and continuous functional exercises. This type of training enhances the muscle's ability to utilize oxygen and sustain contractions over longer periods. Recovery and ATP Replenishment Ensuring adequate recovery between training sessions is essential for maintaining optimal ATP levels and muscle function. Strategies include proper nutrition, hydration, sleep, and active recovery techniques such as stretching and low-intensity exercise. Nutritional interventions, particularly those that replenish glycogen stores and provide adequate protein, are crucial for muscle repair and ATP resynthesis. Understanding the mechanisms of muscle contraction and the role of ATP allows HYROX athletes to optimize their training regimens. By focusing on exercises that enhance both strength and endurance, athletes can improve their performance across the diverse challenges presented in HYROX competitions. Moreover, incorporating effective recovery strategies ensures that muscles are prepared for subsequent training sessions and competitions, reducing the risk of injury and maximizing performance potential. In conclusion, the intricate process of muscle contraction, driven by the interaction of actin and myosin filaments and regulated by the nervous system, is fundamental to athletic performance. For HYROX athletes, mastering the principles of muscle contraction and ATP utilization is key to excelling in the physically demanding and varied events of HYROX competitions. Through targeted strength and endurance training, along with proper recovery practices, athletes can optimize their muscle function and achieve peak performance. Chapter: Cardiovascular Dynamics: How does the cardiovascular system support exercise? During physical activity, the cardiovascular system undergoes significant changes to meet the increased demands of working muscles. The heart rate, stroke volume, and cardiac output all increase, ensuring that more oxygen and nutrients are delivered to the muscles. The heart rate accelerates to pump blood more rapidly through the circulatory system. This increase allows for a quicker delivery of oxygen and nutrients to the active muscles. The Stroke volume, which is the amount of blood ejected by the heart with each beat, also increases. This is due to enhanced venous return and more forceful heart contractions, enabling a greater volume of blood to be circulated. The Cardiac output, the total volume of blood pumped by the heart per minute, is a product of heart rate and stroke volume. During exercise, both factors contribute to a substantial rise in cardiac output, significantly enhancing the body’s ability to transport oxygen and nutrients. Redistribution of Blood Flow During exercise, the body prioritizes blood flow to the muscles that are actively engaged in physical activity. This is achieved through the process of vasodilation in the arterioles supplying the working muscles and vasoconstriction in the arterioles of non-essential organs. Vasodilation and Vasoconstriction Vasodilation increases blood flow to the muscles by widening the blood vessels, while vasoconstriction reduces blood flow to organs such as the kidneys and digestive system, which are not as active during exercise. This redistribution ensures that the maximum amount of oxygen and nutrients is available to the muscles that need it most. Oxygen Delivery The increased cardiac output and targeted blood flow ensure that the working muscles receive an adequate supply of oxygen, which is crucial for aerobic metabolism and sustained muscle activity. Oxygen is transported by hemoglobin in the red blood cells and is released into the muscle tissues to support energy production. Nutrient Delivery In addition to oxygen, nutrients such as glucose and fatty acids are delivered more efficiently to the working muscles. These nutrients serve as critical energy sources, supporting both anaerobic and aerobic metabolic processes. Implications for HYROX Athletes For HYROX athletes, understanding the cardiovascular response to exercise is key to optimizing performance. The various HYROX events, which combine running with functional exercises, require efficient cardiovascular function to maintain endurance and strength throughout the competition. Training Adaptations Regular cardiovascular training enhances the heart’s ability to increase stroke volume and cardiac output, leading to improved performance. Endurance training, such as long-distance running and interval training, can strengthen the heart muscle, increase blood volume, and improve the efficiency of the cardiovascular system. Performance Benefits Improved cardiovascular function allows HYROX athletes to sustain higher intensities for longer periods, delay the onset of fatigue, and recover more quickly between exercises. This is particularly important in a competition that demands both aerobic and anaerobic endurance. In conclusion, during physical activity, the cardiovascular system undergoes significant changes to support the increased metabolic demands of the muscles. The heart rate, stroke volume, and cardiac output all increase to enhance oxygen and nutrient delivery. Blood flow is strategically redirected from non-essential organs to the muscles in need, ensuring optimal performance. For HYROX athletes, optimizing these cardiovascular responses through targeted training can lead to significant improvements in endurance, strength, and overall competition performance. Chapter: Respiratory Adaptations: How does the respiratory system respond to exercise? Acute Responses to Exercise What happens in the body during exercise? Acute responses refer to the immediate physiological changes that occur when the body engages in physical activity. The cardiovascular response to exercise involves several key changes to meet the increased demands of physical activity. The heart rate increases to pump more blood to the muscles, and blood pressure elevates to ensure adequate blood flow. Additionally, there is enhanced blood flow distribution, redirecting blood to active muscles and away from less essential areas. These adaptations ensure that working muscles receive sufficient oxygen and nutrients, supporting sustained physical performance. The respiratory response to exercise includes several key changes to meet the increased demands for oxygen. The breathing rate increases to ensure a higher intake of oxygen, while the tidal volume, or the amount of air inhaled and exhaled with each breath, becomes greater. These adaptations enhance the body's ability to supply oxygen to the muscles and remove carbon dioxide, supporting sustained physical activity and improved performance. And finally, let's have a look at the muscular response to exercise. This response includes increased ATP production through both anaerobic and aerobic pathways, ensuring that muscles have the necessary energy for sustained contractions. Additionally, there is increased heat production as a byproduct of heightened metabolic activity within the muscles. These changes are essential for maintaining muscle performance and effectiveness during physical exertion, allowing the body to meet the demands of exercise efficiently. Chronic Adaptations to Exercise What changes occur in the body as a result of regular exercise? Chronic adaptations refer to the long-term physiological changes that result from consistent physical activity over weeks, months, or years. Cardiovascular adaptations Cardiovascular adaptations to exercise result in several key changes within the heart and vascular system. One significant adaptation is a lower resting heart rate, which occurs due to an increased stroke volume, meaning the heart pumps more blood with each beat. Additionally, there is an increase in capillary density, enhancing the delivery of nutrients and oxygen to tissues. Improved cardiac efficiency also develops, allowing the heart to pump blood more effectively. These adaptations collectively contribute to better cardiovascular health and performance, especially important for athletes and individuals engaging in regular physical activity. Respiratory adaptations Respiratory adaptations to exercise involve significant improvements in lung function. Enhanced lung capacity allows for a greater volume of air to be inhaled and exhaled, supporting increased respiratory efficiency. Additionally, there is increased oxygen uptake due to more efficient gas exchange in the alveoli, optimizing the delivery of oxygen to the bloodstream and the removal of carbon dioxide. These changes enhance overall respiratory performance, contributing to better endurance and athletic capabilities. Muscular adaptations And finally there are also muscular adaptations to exercise which include several key changes that enhance performance. Hypertrophy, the increase in muscle size and strength, is one of the primary adaptations. Additionally, there is an increase in mitochondrial density, meaning more mitochondria are available to support aerobic metabolism, which improves endurance. Furthermore, muscles improve their glycogen storage capacity, allowing for more energy to be stored and utilized during physical activity. These adaptations collectively contribute to greater strength, endurance, and overall athletic performance. Chapter: Practical Applications of Exercise Physiology How can we apply exercise physiology in real life? The principles of exercise physiology are utilized in various fields, including sports performance, clinical rehabilitation, and public health. Athletes use exercise physiology to enhance their training programs, optimize performance, and prevent injuries. For example, understanding the energy systems can help a sprinter improve their explosive power, while an endurance athlete - like a HYROX athlete - might focus on increasing their VO2 max. But also in clinical rehabilitation exercise physiology plays a vital role: Exercise physiologists develop rehabilitation programs for patients recovering from injuries or surgeries. By understanding the body's response to exercise, they can design safe and effective protocols that promote recovery and restore function. For long COVID, research highlights the benefits of graded exercise therapy to alleviate symptoms like fatigue and muscle weakness. These programs, which include aerobic exercises, strength training, and flexibility exercises, are designed to enhance overall fitness and function. This approach underscores the vital role of exercise physiologists in promoting recovery and restoring well- being. In the context of public health, exercise physiology informs initiatives aimed at reducing chronic diseases through physical activity. By understanding how exercise impacts the body, programs are designed to encourage regular physical activity, which can effectively combat obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases. These initiatives focus on promoting fitness and wellness in communities, emphasizing the importance of exercise in maintaining overall health and preventing chronic conditions. Exercise physiologists play a crucial role in developing and implementing these programs, ensuring they are both effective and accessible to the public. Current Research in Exercise Physiology Research in this field is continually evolving, with new findings enhancing our understanding of how exercise impacts the body. Recent studies have explored the role of exercise in mitochondrial biogenesis, the process by which new mitochondria are formed in cells. This research has significant implications for improving athletic performance and managing diseases characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction. Another area of interest is the impact of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) on cardiovascular health. Studies have shown that HIIT can provide similar or even superior cardiovascular benefits compared to traditional endurance training, making it a popular choice for athletes and fitness enthusiasts. To summarize, exercise physiology is a vital field that bridges the gap between science and physical activity. By understanding the body's responses and adaptations to exercise, we can optimize performance, enhance health, and improve quality of our life and the life of our clients and athletes."

Chapter: Summary Before diving into HYROX, assess your current workouts. Are they specifically designed to prepare you for the demands of the competition, which includes a mix of running, functional movements, and sled pushes? This initial evaluation helps ensure your training translates to success on race day. • Your body utilizes two primary energy systems to fuel movement: aerobic (with oxygen) and anaerobic (without oxygen). Understanding the contribution of each system during different exercise durations is crucial. • Shorter, high-intensity bursts like a 400-meter sprint rely heavily on the anaerobic system for quick energy delivery. Conversely, longer efforts like a 10,000-meter run see a significant shift towards the aerobic system, drawing energy from oxygen intake. • Unlike a pure sprint or distance run, HYROX is a test of overall fitness that requires sustained effort throughout the entire competition. Building a strong aerobic base becomes essential for maintaining performance across various functional movements. • While speed, strength, and power are valuable, solely focusing on short, intense workouts neglects the crucial element of endurance. A well-rounded HYROX training plan incorporates exercises that target both anaerobic and aerobic energy systems, ensuring you're prepared for the diverse challenges of the competition."

--> 00:01:07.280 This is important because we --> 00:01:09.359 don't want them to be surprised. --> 00:01:14.079 If they do underperform, then whose responsibility was it? --> 00:01:17.359 This is how you get them to take action. --> 00:01:21.040 When athletes blame us, they don't come back. --> 00:01:24.480 When they blame themselves, they wanna have a second shot. --> 00:01:27.599 And this is how we as coaches get retention. --> 00:01:29.280 And it's the most important --> 00:01:30.840 thing that we should be judged on. --> 00:01:32.480 Do they wanna come back? --> 00:01:35.959 So I would ask, how long does it going --> 00:01:38.359 to take you athlete to be able to do this --> 00:01:39.200 event? --> 00:01:40.560 And let's just say that they say, --> 00:01:42.599 we're gonna have it done in 80 minutes. --> 00:01:43.560 Fair enough. --> 00:01:45.760 80 minutes is the total amount of time. --> 00:01:46.879 Now we have a benchmark. --> 00:01:49.519 Matter of fact, we can create our level --> 00:01:51.680 of intensity based upon that 80 minutes. --> 00:01:53.439 We could start building structure. --> 00:01:56.760 They can understand what that means. --> 00:02:00.760 Once we have that, the athlete must go back and --> 00:02:03.319 they have to look at the --> 00:02:05.840 obstacles and which obstacle for them. --> 00:02:09.159 Which obstacle is gonna present the biggest challenge? --> 00:02:11.120 And why is this important? --> 00:02:13.120 Because if an athlete --> 00:02:16.000 underestimates the amount of difficulty that they --> 00:02:17.560 experience with that particular --> 00:02:21.240 obstacle, they will with 100% certainty, --> 00:02:22.360 underperform. --> 00:02:24.439 It's what's called a hazard score. --> 00:02:26.759 It's your perceived amount of pain, --> 00:02:29.919 what you think it's going to be before and --> 00:02:30.919 what it is actually. --> 00:02:34.599 And we need to make sure that the two of these match up. --> 00:02:35.520 So why? --> 00:02:37.599 The brain's not surprised. --> 00:02:41.319 If the brain is surprised, you absolutely underperform. --> 00:02:45.479 So get them to commit to you as --> 00:02:47.680 the coach their level of difficulty. --> 00:02:50.000 The other piece within the HYROX --> 00:02:52.759 competition is the sticking point of --> 00:02:53.879 the overall event. --> 00:02:56.520 Where, within that 80 minute time --> 00:02:59.520 domain, do they get to a certain point? --> 00:03:02.759 And many people will say it's after the burpee broad jumps. --> 00:03:05.000 Where all of a sudden, within --> 00:03:06.680 their own head, they say to themselves, --> 00:03:09.639 I've got it, I've got it. --> 00:03:11.400 That's an important point. --> 00:03:14.639 So that when they encounter those burpee broad jumps, --> 00:03:16.240 they know it's gonna be a struggle. --> 00:03:18.479 But they also know as part of --> 00:03:20.520 their plan, it's gonna get better. --> 00:03:24.759 Remember, you must prepare the brain so it's not surprised. --> 00:03:26.439 And that's going to occur in HYROX --> 00:03:28.960 in two places, the obstacles and --> 00:03:31.240 with the event on its entirety. --> 00:03:34.080 Now, the last piece and --> 00:03:36.120 coaches, this is the most important. --> 00:03:40.479 Because athletes, when that gun goes off, panic occurs. --> 00:03:42.759 Everybody's gonna go out fast. --> 00:03:46.039 And this is where athletes have to exercise control. --> 00:03:50.360 They have to be able to control their pace. --> 00:03:51.520 But what is the target pace? --> 00:03:54.199 What's so amazing about what HYROX --> 00:03:56.719 did is that they created an event --> 00:04:00.800 that allows this to actually become easy to approximate. --> 00:04:03.159 If you think the total amount of --> 00:04:06.000 time is 80 minutes, all right athlete, --> 00:04:08.759 then how do we predict your actual --> 00:04:10.199 target pace for that thousand meters? --> 00:04:12.560 Well, half the total amount of time is running. --> 00:04:13.800 That means that your total --> 00:04:16.319 accumulated run time is 40 minutes. --> 00:04:18.879 If there's 8,000 meters of running, --> 00:04:21.240 eight intervals, so 40 divided by eight, --> 00:04:24.959 that's five minutes per thousand meters. --> 00:04:28.000 That's how you're gonna determine the --> 00:04:30.000 opening pace for the opening thousand. --> 00:04:32.720 Now athletes are gonna think that that's slow. --> 00:04:35.560 Remember, we're gonna build into it. --> 00:04:37.000 It's 80 minutes. --> 00:04:40.920 Allow the aerobic system to fully turn on. --> 00:04:43.519 The key is patience. --> 00:04:45.279 Patience is the key. --> 00:04:47.240 And the way that you're gonna do that --> 00:04:50.040 is by driving home that first thousand --> 00:04:50.560 meter pace. --> 00:04:54.120 Once the fuse is lit, the rest will take care of itself. --> 00:04:56.319 All right, coaches, good luck with that. Chapter: Summary Pre-Race Strategy for Success Building Confidence and Managing Expectations: Athlete Responsibility: Shift the focus to athlete ownership by having them estimate their race time. This fosters accountability and reduces blame if they underperform. Hazard Scoring: Identify obstacles that pose the biggest challenge for each athlete. This helps manage expectations and prevents mental roadblocks during the race. Sticking Point Awareness: Prepare athletes for the \"wall\" they might hit during the race (e.g., post-burpee broad jumps). Knowing it's coming and having a plan to push through builds mental resilience. Targeting Race Pace: Pace Control: Encourage athletes to start slow and gradually increase pace. HYROX's race format (8x 1km runs) allows for easy target pace calculation. Opening Pace Calculation: Divide total race time (e.g., 80 minutes) in half for total running time (40 minutes). Divide running time by the number of runs (8) to determine target pace per kilometer (5 minutes). Patience is Key: Starting slow allows the aerobic system to engage and ensures sustainable energy throughout the race. Coach's Role - Building Trust and Retention: Communication and Education: Coaches guide athletes in understanding the race format, obstacles, and pacing strategies, fostering trust and confidence. Retention Focus: By empowering athletes and setting realistic expectations, coaches encourage repeat business and build long-term client relationships."

00:00:28.679 And so we're gonna dive into this chart here. --> 00:00:30.920 Where do we get our energy from? --> 00:00:33.960 And this is gonna take us into two main topics. --> 00:00:36.280 One is the importance of the warmup. --> 00:00:39.479 What do we do during the warmup matters. --> 00:00:41.280 It not only matters in our training, --> 00:00:43.280 but it also matters when we're looking --> 00:00:44.640 to maximize that performance --> 00:00:47.320 in that most efficient and effective way. --> 00:00:51.600 So this chart is what we know is our metabolic pathways, --> 00:00:53.759 our energy systems. --> 00:00:57.799 And you see up here, there's three core energy systems. --> 00:00:58.799 There's the phosphogen system, --> 00:01:01.159 we have the anaerobic system, --> 00:01:02.759 and then we have the aerobic system. --> 00:01:05.519 And those last two is what we just discussed earlier. --> 00:01:08.159 But what I want you to understand is, --> 00:01:13.319 how do we use these particular energy systems in real life? --> 00:01:15.840 For example, in a HYROX competition, --> 00:01:18.040 when you hear three, two, one go, --> 00:01:20.920 what happens with the consumption of energy? --> 00:01:25.519 More importantly, item number two, this concept of pacing. --> 00:01:27.319 You don't have unlimited energy. --> 00:01:30.079 You can't just take it out fast and hope you hang on. --> 00:01:31.879 This is where death occurs. --> 00:01:36.040 We must maximize the consumption of our available energy --> 00:01:37.760 in order to maximize result. --> 00:01:43.519 So how do these energy systems get consumed matters? --> 00:01:46.120 But let's talk about the first thing first. --> 00:01:49.760 Number one, why do we warm up? --> 00:01:52.799 All right, in a competition at three, two, one go. --> 00:01:54.000 Gun goes off. --> 00:01:57.239 What happens here is all three of these energy systems --> 00:02:00.439 are going to turn on at the exact same time. --> 00:02:04.079 But their delivery, the delivery of the energy --> 00:02:07.840 to the muscles that are needed in order to help you --> 00:02:10.639 start that first thousand meter run, they're staggered. --> 00:02:13.120 The first energy system to turn on --> 00:02:15.120 is that phosphagen pathway. --> 00:02:17.680 And as you'll notice in that phosphagen pathway, --> 00:02:21.319 it delivers more energy than the other two energy systems. --> 00:02:24.080 So how do we leverage that? --> 00:02:26.120 If it has this incredible amount of energy, --> 00:02:29.520 how do we put it to good use in our strategy --> 00:02:30.800 in a competition? --> 00:02:34.400 And then more importantly, how can we train it? --> 00:02:38.639 So at three, two, one go, why not take advantage --> 00:02:40.719 of this maximal amount of energy output? --> 00:02:43.840 Why not start fast? --> 00:02:46.439 And then what you have to do is settle --> 00:02:48.400 because you'll realize that that energy system --> 00:02:50.759 is good for about 10 seconds of total time. --> 00:02:54.759 It also burns cleanly, so you have no risk. --> 00:02:58.879 What I want you to do is start fast and recognize --> 00:03:01.240 that you're gonna burn through that system --> 00:03:04.039 with no consequence in about 10 seconds. --> 00:03:06.159 So you gotta settle your speed --> 00:03:08.800 because the next energy system that kicks in --> 00:03:10.800 is that anaerobic pathway. --> 00:03:14.800 And this system, yes, it delivers a high amount of energy. --> 00:03:18.240 It lasts for about 75 seconds of total time, --> 00:03:21.240 but here's the problem, is it does not burn clean. --> 00:03:23.560 We have all heard of lactic acid. --> 00:03:26.159 Lactate and this acidity. --> 00:03:29.199 If this acidity builds, what it will ultimately do --> 00:03:31.360 is interfere with the muscle's ability to function. --> 00:03:35.280 If you don't slow down and remove this acidity, --> 00:03:37.120 the body will shut you down. --> 00:03:39.439 It will interfere with the muscle's ability to function, --> 00:03:43.000 and what will happen is the body will shut you down. --> 00:03:46.520 So you either slow or the body forces you to slow. --> 00:03:50.319 Now, I want you to recognize that this system --> 00:03:54.000 is the one we don't want to use until the very end --> 00:03:57.240 or within the obstacles that we struggle with. --> 00:04:01.639 What we wanna do is get our aerobic system turned on, --> 00:04:04.520 but look at the length of time the aerobic system takes. --> 00:04:07.280 It's a gradual ramping. --> 00:04:10.960 For me, my resting heart rate is around 54. --> 00:04:14.360 My cruising heart rate, when my aerobic system --> 00:04:16.279 is fully turned on, is a heart rate of 162. --> 00:04:19.399 If I don't get a good warmup in, --> 00:04:23.199 that is going to take me about 90 seconds to fully turn on. --> 00:04:26.279 Well, from the time it takes to turn on, --> 00:04:30.000 from when my phosphagen system actually was depleted, --> 00:04:34.240 I've got a good at least 80 seconds of total duration --> 00:04:36.879 where I am using that anaerobic source of energy, --> 00:04:39.879 meaning my muscles are getting flooded with lactic acid. --> 00:04:42.800 That acidity is a concern. --> 00:04:44.279 We don't wanna use it. --> 00:04:48.560 So the reason, number one, why you wanna get a warmup in --> 00:04:51.199 is to warm up your cardiorespiratory system --> 00:04:52.959 to get your heart rate elevated. --> 00:04:55.720 What I want you to do is do something --> 00:04:58.120 to get your heart rate, not at maximum, --> 00:05:02.839 but get it close enough to your cruising race heart rate --> 00:05:04.480 that you would experience on average. --> 00:05:08.079 By doing that, your heart rate at three, two, one, go, --> 00:05:10.720 when the gun goes off, won't take 90 seconds --> 00:05:12.240 to get fully turned on. --> 00:05:14.839 You'll compress the amount of time --> 00:05:17.199 and it will take you about 60 seconds. --> 00:05:18.839 That's what I want you to realize --> 00:05:21.000 is that if you get a warmup in, --> 00:05:23.439 you can compress that amount of time. --> 00:05:26.079 The second piece of a warmup that we must address --> 00:05:27.839 is our range of motion. --> 00:05:31.240 Remember, we have to prepare the muscles --> 00:05:33.839 for what they're about to do so you're not surprised. --> 00:05:37.360 100% of the time, if you don't prepare the muscles --> 00:05:39.160 for what they're about to experience, --> 00:05:40.639 you will underperform. --> 00:05:44.079 So what you need to do is dynamic drills. --> 00:05:46.759 The purpose of these dynamic drills --> 00:05:49.000 is to open up that range of motion. --> 00:05:51.399 You want to realize that in HYROX, --> 00:05:53.879 you're going to test every single muscle group. --> 00:05:57.120 The most important pieces though, the run, --> 00:06:00.319 you've got to prepare for that first thousand meters. --> 00:06:02.800 So the most important dynamic drills --> 00:06:05.000 that you need to practice as part of your warmup --> 00:06:09.079 are ones that open up that running range of motion. --> 00:06:12.079 And that's the purpose of doing these dynamic drills. --> 00:06:13.959 You, as part of this module, --> 00:06:17.759 are going to receive an entire list of dynamic drills --> 00:06:19.240 that you can perform. --> 00:06:22.240 Read through those and practice those --> 00:06:26.000 because that must be item number two that you incorporate. --> 00:06:29.519 Now the third and the final piece in your warmup protocol, --> 00:06:32.439 it needs to warm up the neurological system. --> 00:06:33.759 It needs to warm up your brain. --> 00:06:35.839 Remember, your brain sends the signal --> 00:06:39.360 down to the various limbs to make them move. --> 00:06:40.959 When the brain is tired, --> 00:06:43.079 it sends the signal the long way down. --> 00:06:45.720 But you know what we can do is we can tighten it --> 00:06:48.800 and streamline that signal to take from the brain --> 00:06:51.720 down, let's say, to the feet because of the running. --> 00:06:52.959 How do we do that? --> 00:06:55.319 Well, you're going to challenge the brain --> 00:06:57.360 by doing short sprints. --> 00:07:00.879 You're going to make that brain sequence muscle fibers, --> 00:07:02.920 recruit muscle fibers fast. --> 00:07:05.639 By doing it fast in a short little sprint, --> 00:07:07.079 the brain will be challenged. --> 00:07:09.519 The brain adapts very quick. --> 00:07:12.399 In about three, what we call stride outs, --> 00:07:17.240 or 60 meter, maybe even 80 meter controlled sprints, --> 00:07:19.680 what you will do is prime the brain --> 00:07:21.879 so it sends the signal faster, --> 00:07:23.879 more streamlined down to the feet. --> 00:07:25.240 That is important. --> 00:07:27.360 You want to make sure that you --> 00:07:28.959 get those controlled sprints. --> 00:07:30.399 Notice I said the word controlled. --> 00:07:33.240 Controlled means about 98% effort. --> 00:07:36.680 What you're doing is not flailing, not panicking. --> 00:07:37.839 You're controlled. --> 00:07:40.160 You're retaining the control of your form. --> 00:07:41.879 The worst thing that you could do --> 00:07:43.519 is get hurt while doing your warm up. --> 00:07:46.399 We're trying just to challenge the brain. --> 00:07:49.360 Remember, every single thing we're doing in the warm up --> 00:07:50.160 must have purpose. --> 00:07:52.199 The purpose of these stride outs, --> 00:07:54.319 these short little sprints, is to prepare --> 00:07:56.560 your neurological system so that it's --> 00:07:59.639 operating the most efficient when that gun goes off. Chapter: Summary HYROX Warm-Up: 3 Key Strategies for Peak Performance Optimize Energy Delivery with a Targeted Warm-Up: A good warm-up prepares your body to use energy systems efficiently during HYROX. The phosphagen system provides a short, powerful burst of energy at the start. A warm-up elevates your heart rate closer to cruising pace, reducing reliance on the lactic acid-producing anaerobic system. This delays fatigue and maintains consistent performance throughout HYROX. Enhance Muscle Readiness with Dynamic Stretches: Dynamic stretches like leg swings improve range of motion for exercises like sled pushes. This allows you to move with greater ease and power, maximizing performance. Dynamic stretches also increase blood flow to your muscles, preparing them for exertion and reducing injury risk. Sharpen Coordination with Short Sprints (Stride-Outs): HYROX requires sharp coordination and quick reactions. Short, controlled sprints (stride-outs) challenge your brain to send rapid signals to your muscles. This improves nerve transmission and muscle fiber recruitment, leading to better coordination and efficient movement patterns. Stride-outs should be controlled efforts at around 98% intensity to avoid injuries."

--> 00:00:55.520 They certainly shouldn't be thinking about --> 00:00:56.759 all the things that they're about to do --> 00:00:59.240 in that total, let's say, 80 minutes of time domain. --> 00:01:02.000 They need to be thinking about one thing, --> 00:01:04.560 and that is, what am I going to do --> 00:01:06.799 when it says three, two, one, go? --> 00:01:07.959 The very first thing. --> 00:01:09.719 And what I'm telling you is, --> 00:01:12.519 take advantage of the phosphagen energy system --> 00:01:13.680 that we discussed earlier. --> 00:01:17.920 It delivers maximal energy, it burns cleanly, --> 00:01:20.280 and it's good for a total 10 seconds of time. --> 00:01:24.359 What they must do is only think of that. --> 00:01:25.840 That's it. --> 00:01:29.239 And that will help them light the fuse --> 00:01:31.120 to create a better performance. --> 00:01:34.079 So remember, fast 10 seconds. --> 00:01:36.879 Now earlier, I mentioned to you --> 00:01:39.680 that it's going to take 60 seconds --> 00:01:41.599 because you did give them a good warmup --> 00:01:45.239 for their aerobic system to fully contribute energy. --> 00:01:49.120 So, what the athlete must realize is, --> 00:01:51.439 the most dangerous amount of time --> 00:01:53.439 within a HYROX competition is, --> 00:01:56.799 from when that phosphagen system is depleted, --> 00:02:01.719 which is 10 seconds, until the aerobic system kicks in. --> 00:02:04.359 There is a 50 second block of time --> 00:02:05.680 where you're going to get energy --> 00:02:08.319 from that most dangerous source of energy of them all. --> 00:02:11.919 That anaerobic pathway where this lactic acid --> 00:02:14.439 is going to accumulate in the muscles that are moving. --> 00:02:18.039 This is where athletes must exercise patience. --> 00:02:20.360 They must stay calm. --> 00:02:23.800 And it is a very, very difficult thing. --> 00:02:27.680 But you have to allow that aerobic system --> 00:02:30.719 to fully contribute maximal energy. --> 00:02:34.319 And again, if they got a good warmup in, it's 60 seconds. --> 00:02:37.240 If they didn't get a good warmup in, it's 90 seconds. --> 00:02:41.080 Once that time expires, now they're free to fly. --> 00:02:44.080 But be patient in that time period. --> 00:02:46.960 But also recognize that it is tough for them. --> 00:02:49.719 So if I was positioning myself as a coach, --> 00:02:51.400 and I have an athlete that is competing, --> 00:02:53.039 where am I going to be? --> 00:02:56.960 I'm gonna be somewhere around 30 seconds downstream --> 00:03:00.800 to remind them to pump the brakes, to calm down. --> 00:03:02.400 It's a long event. --> 00:03:04.400 And patience is important. --> 00:03:09.240 That is what mature athletes are actually able to do. --> 00:03:11.039 They don't ruin it at the start. --> 00:03:13.599 So remind them, be patient. --> 00:03:15.240 And once you look down at your watch --> 00:03:17.800 and 60 seconds have gone by, then go for it. --> 00:03:18.400 Hit the gas. --> 00:03:20.400 But you know what's beautiful about that moment? --> 00:03:22.400 They're gonna be settled into --> 00:03:24.719 what we call your sustainable pace. --> 00:03:26.240 And that's important. --> 00:03:28.719 The sustainable pace is based upon --> 00:03:31.199 the total amount of time that you think --> 00:03:33.159 it's going to take for that athlete --> 00:03:35.360 to do that particular competition. --> 00:03:39.159 This is what we call your lactate threshold pace, --> 00:03:41.360 your maximum sustainable intensity. --> 00:03:44.360 And what your fitness will do is define --> 00:03:47.400 that particular intensity for them. --> 00:03:49.719 And there's not much that they can do --> 00:03:52.439 other than stay at that particular space --> 00:03:56.639 with the exception of when they encounter an obstacle, --> 00:03:58.240 where they are challenged, --> 00:04:02.599 where they actually have to go into a non-sustainable pace. --> 00:04:06.039 What I wanna do is I want you to understand coaches --> 00:04:11.120 how to articulate a non-sustainable pace to your athlete. --> 00:04:14.520 And the context is, think about the Mount Everest. --> 00:04:18.720 Mount Everest, it's a 29,000 foot mountain. --> 00:04:22.040 On Mount Everest, there is what we call a death zone. --> 00:04:24.759 The death zone is at 26,000 feet --> 00:04:28.000 and just below 26,000 feet is Camp 4. --> 00:04:30.920 Now, they call it a death zone --> 00:04:33.600 because above that 26,000 feet, --> 00:04:36.000 there's insufficient oxygen to keep the brain alive. --> 00:04:39.600 So when you climb Everest, certainly you could go --> 00:04:41.600 into that death zone and above it and summit, --> 00:04:43.560 but it's a race against time. --> 00:04:46.959 If you get trapped above that line with 100% certainty, --> 00:04:48.240 you don't make it. --> 00:04:51.000 So you gotta get up and back down to Camp 4 --> 00:04:53.000 as fast as you possibly can. --> 00:04:54.199 And that's why it's dangerous. --> 00:04:57.399 Think about your maximum sustainable pace --> 00:04:59.000 as your death zone. --> 00:05:01.040 You could go above it, --> 00:05:02.959 but you're not gonna stay there for long. --> 00:05:06.360 As a matter of fact, most athletes can stay above that line --> 00:05:08.360 for between two and four minutes, --> 00:05:09.879 depending upon their level of fitness, --> 00:05:13.240 and keep 100% of their muscle fibers active. --> 00:05:15.600 But after that amount of time, --> 00:05:19.160 that acidity is going to start to accumulate --> 00:05:21.160 and it will begin interfering --> 00:05:22.839 with the muscle's ability to function. --> 00:05:25.000 And because you're not slowing down, --> 00:05:27.959 the muscles will be forced to slow down --> 00:05:29.759 from this accumulation of acidity. --> 00:05:32.800 And it will bring you back down below that death zone, --> 00:05:34.399 that maximum sustainable pace. --> 00:05:37.800 And so when you're explaining to the athlete, --> 00:05:41.319 they must be aware that if they have an obstacle, --> 00:05:43.839 and you're gonna take a risk and go above that line, --> 00:05:47.360 that you could only do it for a certain amount of time, --> 00:05:48.600 and then you've gotta recover. --> 00:05:51.120 Now, a lot of people will come to me and they'll say, --> 00:05:52.600 what does it feel like? --> 00:05:54.519 Like, how do I know that I've crossed over? --> 00:05:56.279 Well, one of the pieces that --> 00:05:57.759 you will get within this module --> 00:06:00.680 is different levels of intensity, --> 00:06:05.079 and how do you understand based upon what the body does --> 00:06:07.759 at different levels of intensity? --> 00:06:09.879 Breathing is a perfect example. --> 00:06:11.959 Nasal breathing is a perfect example. --> 00:06:15.040 Conversational pace, and it's all within that chart. --> 00:06:17.279 But I wanna actually do one step further. --> 00:06:21.759 I want you to realize that your body, your brain, --> 00:06:25.120 specifically tells you when you have crossed over --> 00:06:26.519 into a non-sustainable pace. --> 00:06:29.439 So what I want you coaches, I want you to think about this. --> 00:06:31.759 If I have you do one lap around the track --> 00:06:34.600 as fast as you possibly can, 400 meters, --> 00:06:37.879 one time, all the way around that track, --> 00:06:40.040 what I want you to think about is, --> 00:06:43.600 as you are running, and your maximum effort, --> 00:06:46.000 and you're progressing through, right? --> 00:06:49.399 You pass 100 meters, you're coming down that back stretch, --> 00:06:51.439 and you're now at 200 meters. --> 00:06:53.680 You got another 200 meters to go. --> 00:06:58.040 At what point in time in that final 200 meters --> 00:07:01.560 do you all of a sudden feel the sensation of, --> 00:07:04.399 I need to slow down, I'm going too fast. --> 00:07:06.360 It's where a negative thought may pop into your head. --> 00:07:10.959 Where all of a sudden you feel this lack of confidence. --> 00:07:13.199 Where you're not sure anymore. --> 00:07:15.560 It's where the brain is sitting there and saying, --> 00:07:17.279 man, if you don't slow down, we're not gonna finish. --> 00:07:22.120 Now for me, that occurs around 240, 250 meters in. --> 00:07:24.079 I encounter this uh-oh moment. --> 00:07:28.120 But if I continue on, and I get to 300 meters, --> 00:07:29.480 and I'm down that final stretch, --> 00:07:31.000 all of a sudden I feel better again. --> 00:07:33.519 That discomfort, it ends up going away. --> 00:07:36.240 But what particularly happened? --> 00:07:39.759 And I want you to realize that what I explained to you --> 00:07:43.560 is universal, it happens in 100% of all athletes. --> 00:07:46.000 They hit where the brain says, --> 00:07:49.199 if you don't slow down, you're not gonna finish. --> 00:07:53.160 What I want you to recognize is why does that occur? --> 00:07:54.560 Why at 240? --> 00:07:57.519 What physically, what's happening to me? --> 00:08:01.519 Well, I actually went above in a non-sustainable pace. --> 00:08:04.720 And the brain's telling me, if I don't slow down, --> 00:08:06.319 I'm gonna die. --> 00:08:09.600 And so what I want you to be aware of, coaches, --> 00:08:11.439 is talk to your athletes. --> 00:08:14.800 And if they feel sensation, if they taste blood, --> 00:08:17.800 but there's no blood, that's a sign that you're in trouble. --> 00:08:20.040 And you must react to it. --> 00:08:22.560 Most think that they're just gonna blow right past it, --> 00:08:23.839 and then they underperform. --> 00:08:27.079 When you get a signal from the brain and it says, --> 00:08:28.800 uh-oh, something's wrong. --> 00:08:33.399 Have them recognize these symptoms and take action. --> 00:08:36.039 This is what we call athlete responsibility. --> 00:08:39.440 Give them the cues and ask them afterwards, --> 00:08:42.720 did you taste it in that sticking obstacle --> 00:08:44.840 that you said before the competition --> 00:08:46.399 was gonna cause you trouble? --> 00:08:49.240 So what I want you to recognize is --> 00:08:53.000 that in that middle portion, after the 10 seconds --> 00:08:55.840 and your patient until the aerobic system kicks in, --> 00:08:59.200 we just ride that line and that's all we can do. --> 00:09:01.080 You could go off the edge of the envelope --> 00:09:04.399 and then back again, but you've got to just stay --> 00:09:06.159 within what you're capable. --> 00:09:11.120 Training, we can actually increase that death zone --> 00:09:14.720 by increasing the amount of speed that you can go at --> 00:09:15.840 at your lactate threshold. --> 00:09:18.320 Back to Everest, imagine your death zone --> 00:09:21.759 isn't at 26,000 feet, it's at 27,000. --> 00:09:23.720 What if we could raise it to 28,000? --> 00:09:25.720 Now I just go from 28 to the summit, --> 00:09:27.799 a thousand and then back down again. --> 00:09:29.879 That's what training does. --> 00:09:32.639 But when you're on race day, that's all you can do. --> 00:09:36.840 The last piece that I wanna tell you is the finish. --> 00:09:40.000 When should you begin to actually push? --> 00:09:42.519 And this is a very important piece, --> 00:09:44.480 is a lot of people, what they're doing is --> 00:09:47.799 they're looking at that last movement, the wall ball. --> 00:09:50.200 And how do you advise an athlete? --> 00:09:53.879 One of the things that I see over and over and over again --> 00:09:56.840 is the athletes actually are coming into that wall ball --> 00:09:59.159 and what they wanna do is they wanna crush it. --> 00:10:01.000 They wanna dominate that last little piece. --> 00:10:05.120 And so they artificially slow that last thousand meters --> 00:10:08.080 and you're seeing huge drop-offs in performance --> 00:10:11.159 because the brain's telling them --> 00:10:14.799 you got a massive difficult obstacle that's coming --> 00:10:16.759 and it challenges everybody. --> 00:10:21.039 What HYROX does is challenges the best of the best --> 00:10:22.080 in that moment. --> 00:10:22.480 Why? --> 00:10:24.960 Everybody's watching and you got the big stage --> 00:10:28.080 and the finish line and that is where all the lights are. --> 00:10:30.279 And so everybody wants to shine there. --> 00:10:34.360 And so what we see is a loss of, in many cases, --> 00:10:35.759 well over a minute in total --> 00:10:37.519 time in that last thousand meters. --> 00:10:41.159 This is where the growth is of an athlete. --> 00:10:44.960 And as coaches, what you must do is advise that athlete --> 00:10:47.960 that you have to stay on the gas. --> 00:10:52.960 I realize that that is going against every single thing --> 00:10:54.759 that they believe and feel. --> 00:10:58.200 But this is where it takes courage. --> 00:11:01.519 Every athlete, if they play it safe, --> 00:11:02.879 they're always gonna play it safe --> 00:11:04.879 and they're always gonna be where they were. --> 00:11:07.519 Athletes that actually advance themselves --> 00:11:10.279 and they actually use a little courage --> 00:11:12.080 where everything in their body, --> 00:11:13.600 their brain is telling them to --> 00:11:15.639 slow down and they take a risk. --> 00:11:18.320 They walk out the other side with confidence. --> 00:11:20.399 And that at the end of the day --> 00:11:21.759 is what we're trying to achieve. --> 00:11:23.720 So recognize coaches. --> 00:11:28.399 There is, across the board, that last 1,000 meters, --> 00:11:31.960 everybody wants to back off because they know what's coming --> 00:11:33.559 and they want to shine. --> 00:11:35.399 Challenge that. --> 00:11:36.519 Have courage. --> 00:11:38.039 Build the confidence there --> 00:11:40.519 because if you want them to truly improve, --> 00:11:41.960 they've gotta take risk. --> 00:11:44.679 Not just on competition day, but in their training. --> 00:11:47.639 So the last piece, what I want --> 00:11:49.159 you to recognize in pacing is --> 00:11:51.960 that for the recreational fitness enthusiast, --> 00:11:55.279 not the competitor, they're going to be able to go --> 00:11:58.440 into that non-sustainable pace for a minimum of two minutes --> 00:12:01.000 and then the muscles are gonna start shutting down on them. --> 00:12:02.960 That accumulation of acidity. --> 00:12:04.840 It leads four minutes. --> 00:12:06.159 Because of their training, --> 00:12:08.320 they're able to tolerate more acidity. --> 00:12:11.080 So recognize the type of athlete you have --> 00:12:13.960 and their potential and let them know --> 00:12:15.600 that when they're competing, --> 00:12:17.799 that they're probably going to experience --> 00:12:20.960 significant fatigue somewhere between that two --> 00:12:22.320 and four minutes of time domain. --> 00:12:23.960 So that they're not surprised. --> 00:12:26.720 But that is a way better approach --> 00:12:29.519 than losing 60 to 90 seconds. --> 00:12:33.399 Remember, the objective there at the end --> 00:12:36.200 is to get the athlete to take risk. --> 00:12:40.039 And the way that HYROX does it, they will take risk. --> 00:12:42.320 But we don't want them coming in rested. --> 00:12:44.399 We're trying to maximize performance, --> 00:12:47.960 what we're also trying to do is change the athlete. --> 00:12:51.879 Coaches, yes, we want to accomplish the goals --> 00:12:52.559 of the athlete. --> 00:12:55.000 But number one, what we're also trying to do --> 00:12:57.120 is change who they are. --> 00:12:59.840 We want them at the end of this event --> 00:13:01.840 to feel good about their accomplishment, --> 00:13:04.960 to feel success, and that is gonna be based --> 00:13:06.080 upon their level of competence. Chapter: Summary Race Day Pacing Strategies The First 10 Seconds: Leverage the phosphagen energy system for a powerful start (lasts 10 seconds). The \"Dangerous\" 50 Seconds: Be patient during the transition from phosphagen to aerobic energy (60 seconds for well-warmed athletes, 90 seconds for others). Lactic acid builds up during this time, so avoid a fast pace. Sustainable Pace: Maintain a pace based on total race time and lactate threshold (maximum sustainable intensity). This pace allows for consistent effort throughout most of the race. Obstacles and Non-Sustainable Pace: Think of obstacles as \"death zones\" similar to climbing Mount Everest. Athletes can push above their sustainable pace for short bursts (2-4 minutes) to conquer obstacles. Listen to the body's signals (e.g., negative thoughts, lack of confidence) to avoid exceeding sustainable limits. Race Finish: Resist the urge to slow down in the final 1000 meters. Maintain race pace to maximize overall performance and avoid large time drops. Encourage athletes to take calculated risks and build confidence through pushing their limits. Non-Sustainable Pace Duration: Recreational athletes: 2 minutes before muscle fatigue sets in. Elite athletes: 4 minutes before muscle fatigue sets in. Knowing this timeframe helps athletes avoid surprises during the race. Overall Race Goal Encourage athletes to take calculated risks throughout training and competition to improve performance and personal growth."

--> 00:00:55.560 Because there's multiple categories --> 00:00:57.159 of these types of fibers. --> 00:00:58.799 There's lots of variations of them. --> 00:01:01.840 But we categorize in this actual module --> 00:01:03.679 to make it easier to understand --> 00:01:07.000 because they all fall within that same category of type. --> 00:01:09.400 Below that, we have what we --> 00:01:11.840 call fast twitch type 2A fibers. --> 00:01:14.359 Now these are what's called a hybrid fiber --> 00:01:17.280 or an intermediate fiber because they sit in between --> 00:01:21.200 the 2B fibers as well as those slow twitch fibers. --> 00:01:25.200 Now we've talked about our aerobic system many times --> 00:01:26.200 and the value of that. --> 00:01:29.640 Your slow twitch fibers are sitting at the bottom. --> 00:01:32.079 Look at the volume of those slow twitch. --> 00:01:32.920 Remember what we said, --> 00:01:35.480 50% of the available fibers --> 00:01:38.000 for most people are slow twitch. --> 00:01:42.599 Now, where do these fibers get their energy from --> 00:01:43.599 to help them contract? --> 00:01:46.599 This matters when we're talking about training protocols. --> 00:01:49.879 We must remember that we must practice --> 00:01:51.879 a variety of intensities --> 00:01:54.920 so that no muscle fiber group gets left behind. --> 00:01:57.560 Well, the same holds true with energy systems. --> 00:02:00.599 If we leave behind a particular energy system, --> 00:02:02.719 then it's just not gonna be available to us. --> 00:02:06.640 HYROX is a very demanding sport --> 00:02:10.120 and we don't want anything left untrained --> 00:02:14.680 because all that's going to do is lead to less than --> 00:02:16.240 what an athlete can deliver. --> 00:02:19.479 So coaches, where do they get this energy from? --> 00:02:23.080 Remember, earlier we talked about phosphogen, --> 00:02:25.439 we talked about anaerobic and we talked about aerobic. --> 00:02:28.960 These fast twitch 2B fibers, --> 00:02:32.719 they get their energy from the phosphagen system --> 00:02:34.360 and that anaerobic system. --> 00:02:36.319 So let's think that through. --> 00:02:40.039 How long do you think these 2B fibers can last for? --> 00:02:41.960 How long can they actually function for --> 00:02:44.039 based upon where they get their energy from? --> 00:02:45.680 Not long. --> 00:02:47.680 That's what I want you to recognize. --> 00:02:50.120 If we scroll all the way down to the bottom --> 00:02:52.599 or the slowest of the slow twitch fibers sit, --> 00:02:55.759 then what do we think about with these fibers? --> 00:02:57.120 What's their strength? --> 00:02:58.360 What's their limitation? --> 00:03:00.000 Walking. --> 00:03:02.000 I've done a 60 hour adventure race. --> 00:03:03.919 I know I could do at least 60 hours. --> 00:03:06.360 So these fibers can endure, --> 00:03:08.199 but you know what they can't do? --> 00:03:09.800 They can't generate speed. --> 00:03:10.960 They can't generate force. --> 00:03:12.039 They can't generate power. --> 00:03:16.360 So remember that, that these ones down here --> 00:03:18.680 of what their value and their contribution is, --> 00:03:21.599 the ones up top are completely different. --> 00:03:23.520 Now, sitting in the middle here, --> 00:03:27.319 we have these slow twitch fibers --> 00:03:30.520 and just above these fibers are these 2Bs. --> 00:03:32.719 These 2A fibers sit in the middle. --> 00:03:34.000 I referenced them earlier. --> 00:03:35.120 They're hybrid fibers. --> 00:03:36.319 Why? --> 00:03:38.599 Because of where they get their energy from. --> 00:03:40.960 These fast twitch fibers get energy from --> 00:03:42.400 the anaerobic system, --> 00:03:44.800 but they also get it from the aerobic system, --> 00:03:46.000 from the oxygen you breathe. --> 00:03:49.879 That means that you can make these fibers endure. --> 00:03:51.240 You can make them go long. --> 00:03:54.439 And so when we talk about your maximum sustainable pace --> 00:03:55.719 and improving upon it, --> 00:03:57.719 where do you think that comes from? --> 00:04:01.120 From actually creating and utilizing and adapting --> 00:04:02.800 these fibers here. --> 00:04:05.240 And that is a very trainable adaptation --> 00:04:08.439 that must be included in through the training protocols --> 00:04:09.800 of all athletes. --> 00:04:13.360 What I also want you to recognize is, --> 00:04:14.960 we have three energy systems. --> 00:04:16.240 We have three muscle fiber groups. --> 00:04:19.600 So when we now start talking about the core intensities, --> 00:04:24.519 what every athlete must actually include is three speeds. --> 00:04:28.439 High intensity, moderate intensity, low intensity. --> 00:04:30.680 We know this as VO2 max. --> 00:04:32.680 We know this as lactate threshold. --> 00:04:34.839 And we know this as aerobic threshold. --> 00:04:39.120 These core intensities are what needs to be programmed --> 00:04:41.160 into your athletes program. --> 00:04:44.000 Now, what dictates the frequency of those --> 00:04:47.279 is dependent upon the type of athlete that you have. --> 00:04:50.240 And that is what will be discussed in the next section. Chapter: Summary Muscle Fibers and Training Intensities Beyond Slow and Fast Twitch: A Deeper Look at Muscle Fibers HYROX training delves deeper than the basic slow-twitch and fast-twitch fiber classification. Here's a breakdown of the key muscle fiber types and their energy sources: Fast Twitch 2B Fibers (Type 2X): These are the elite sprinters of the muscle fiber world. They excel at short, explosive activities like 10-second sprints and single-rep lifts. Their energy comes primarily from the phosphagen and anaerobic systems, limiting their endurance. Fast Twitch 2A Fibers (Hybrid Fibers): These versatile fibers bridge the gap between fast-twitch and slow-twitch. They can utilize both the anaerobic and aerobic systems for energy, allowing them to function for longer durations while generating power. This makes them crucial for improving an athlete's maximum sustainable pace. Slow Twitch Fibers: These endurance champions are built for sustained activities like walking or long-distance running. They rely heavily on the aerobic system for energy, making them fatigue-resistant but lacking in speed and power generation. Training for All Muscle Fibers and Energy Systems: A well-rounded HYROX training program incorporates a variety of intensities to target all muscle fiber types and energy systems. Just like muscle fibers, neglecting any energy system limits its availability during competition. High Intensity: This intensity zone pushes athletes to their VO2 max, training the body to utilize oxygen more efficiently. Activities like interval training fall under this category. Moderate Intensity: This zone focuses on lactate threshold training, allowing athletes to sustain higher efforts for longer durations before lactate buildup becomes a significant factor. Tempo runs are a good example of this intensity. Low Intensity: This zone builds the aerobic base, improving the body's ability to utilize oxygen for energy production. Activities like slow, easy runs fall under this category. Programming for Different Athletes The specific frequency of these core intensities will vary depending on the athlete's type and goals. This will be explored further in the next section. HYROX training goes beyond simply building endurance. By understanding the different muscle fiber types and energy systems, coaches can design programs that target all aspects of an athlete's physiology, leading to maximized performance and well-rounded fitness."

--> 00:02:07.840 Remember, we have to realize what is what we're trying --> 00:02:09.479 to do in foundation building. --> 00:02:12.960 We're trying to pair the bones, the ligaments, --> 00:02:16.039 the tendons, the structure for the pounding --> 00:02:17.000 that's about to occur. --> 00:02:19.479 If we bypass it, the risk of --> 00:02:21.759 injury substantially increases. --> 00:02:24.159 The other thing that we're doing though is, --> 00:02:27.240 we're trying to create a cardiorespiratory adaptation. --> 00:02:30.120 There is a minimum level of intensity --> 00:02:33.159 to create a cardiorespiratory adaptation. --> 00:02:35.879 And this is also very important. --> 00:02:38.080 You don't wanna go too slow. --> 00:02:40.520 And we know that as zone one. --> 00:02:43.319 Zone one is active recovery intensity. --> 00:02:46.240 Zone one is not intended to create --> 00:02:48.319 a cardiorespiratory adaptation. --> 00:02:52.919 The purpose of zone one is to take contaminants --> 00:02:56.520 out of muscle and push nutrients in the muscle. --> 00:03:01.400 It is intended to help accelerate the rate of recovery --> 00:03:04.080 that an athlete has from a competition. --> 00:03:09.000 They wanna actually do this to accelerate their ability --> 00:03:12.159 to actually get back in the gym, to get back on the track, --> 00:03:13.719 to start their training up again. --> 00:03:16.439 So remember, you have a minimum. --> 00:03:20.159 Now, if you do not get a VO2 max test, --> 00:03:23.879 then you're going to have to use some type of a formula --> 00:03:25.439 to come up with it. --> 00:03:28.719 Now, many of these formulas, they use max heart rate. --> 00:03:30.360 There's nine different formulas to come up --> 00:03:31.280 with your own max heart rate. --> 00:03:34.240 Everybody has variation in maximum heart rate. --> 00:03:37.680 So you need to recognize that if you are using a formula --> 00:03:40.800 to come up with your zone two, you're ball parking it. --> 00:03:44.319 But that's okay, because we just need to get you --> 00:03:45.400 within the range. --> 00:03:47.680 That's the most important part. --> 00:03:51.439 Now, for you guys, coaches, it's very simple --> 00:03:53.599 to articulate an athlete. --> 00:03:55.199 Just take Maphitones, and you --> 00:03:56.439 will get a copy of that as well, --> 00:03:57.800 180 minus your age. --> 00:04:00.400 So let's just say that you're 30 years old. --> 00:04:02.240 Athlete tells you 30 years old, --> 00:04:04.360 their target is a heart rate of 150, --> 00:04:06.039 and that would be their zone two. --> 00:04:07.840 What would be the minimum target --> 00:04:10.120 that you would have an athlete actually go after --> 00:04:12.159 in zone two that creates value? --> 00:04:13.599 The minimum is 20 minutes. --> 00:04:15.599 The minimum is 20 minutes. --> 00:04:18.319 Now, many athletes will not be able to do 20 minutes --> 00:04:20.160 at that running pace. --> 00:04:21.240 They won't. --> 00:04:23.079 And so we have to have options. --> 00:04:26.839 We have to actually give them something to feel success. --> 00:04:30.720 So what we've defined is their target heart rate. --> 00:04:33.839 We've also defined the target amount of time --> 00:04:37.519 that our goal is to actually create value in that workout. --> 00:04:40.920 The question is, is that what would be their speed? --> 00:04:43.040 And that's what matters. --> 00:04:45.439 A lot of people don't look at speed --> 00:04:46.759 when they're doing zone two. --> 00:04:48.240 And here's the problem. --> 00:04:50.560 Let's just say that you have that athlete, --> 00:04:53.040 and your job is, I want you just to go out in zone two. --> 00:04:57.040 I would put a min max on there of minus five and plus five. --> 00:04:59.279 So for this 30 year old athlete, --> 00:05:03.399 I want you to stay between 145 and 155 heart rate. --> 00:05:04.240 There's your range. --> 00:05:06.120 So you're gonna do 20 minutes. --> 00:05:08.879 Now imagine at the start when you're feeling fresh, --> 00:05:11.160 you feel good, your energy systems are all topped off. --> 00:05:12.319 What's your speed like? --> 00:05:14.600 And now we're actually moving and we're running. --> 00:05:17.680 You're 10 minutes in, never done this workout before. --> 00:05:18.839 So at around 12 minutes, --> 00:05:20.600 you're gonna start feeling fatigued. --> 00:05:23.680 But coach said, stay within that 145 155. --> 00:05:25.560 What will happen is, --> 00:05:29.399 is that in order to actually stay within that range --> 00:05:32.199 as you get fatigued, your speed is gonna slow. --> 00:05:35.040 So you started fast and ended slow. --> 00:05:36.639 You just taught yourself to get worse. --> 00:05:37.959 You taught yourself to go slow, --> 00:05:40.519 even though the heart rate stayed within that range. --> 00:05:43.720 We're interested in the neuromuscular adaptation. --> 00:05:46.680 So what most people will do is outsmart themselves. --> 00:05:49.040 I'm gonna focus on my pace, my speed. --> 00:05:51.319 They start out at a pace, --> 00:05:52.839 and let's just pick 10 minutes per mile. --> 00:05:55.680 They're gonna stay within that 145 155, --> 00:05:58.759 and they're going to now run, but they're getting tired. --> 00:06:01.279 Coach said, maintain 10 minute per mile pace. --> 00:06:03.160 So what's the heart rate gonna do? --> 00:06:05.240 It's all of a sudden now gonna spike. --> 00:06:08.519 And now you just ruin the purpose of the workout, --> 00:06:10.439 because when it spikes, --> 00:06:12.399 your demand for oxygen went up --> 00:06:13.680 because you actually --> 00:06:15.959 incorporated fast twitch muscle fibers. --> 00:06:20.360 This is a aerobic, slow twitch, muscular stem --> 00:06:21.600 and a building protocol. --> 00:06:22.839 It's foundation. --> 00:06:27.399 Fast twitch fibers have nothing to be involved with --> 00:06:30.279 in a zone two, base building workout. --> 00:06:33.759 What I want you to recognize is the why behind this. --> 00:06:35.759 Coaches, you've got to explain this --> 00:06:38.519 because athletes think always faster is better. --> 00:06:40.480 What happens is this, --> 00:06:44.000 the brain when you start that zone two, it's easy. --> 00:06:45.560 And the brain is responsible --> 00:06:47.160 for the recruitment of motor units. --> 00:06:49.360 And it's gonna give you a small percentage of motor units. --> 00:06:51.240 Now you're actually jogging. --> 00:06:53.519 Those fibers will fatigue and fail. --> 00:06:54.839 The brain is gonna shut them off --> 00:06:57.000 and now they're resting along with all the other fibers. --> 00:06:59.480 It's then gonna bring in another grouping --> 00:07:00.639 of slow twitch fibers. --> 00:07:01.680 You're running again. --> 00:07:03.079 Those fatigue and fail --> 00:07:04.639 and brain shuts them off and they're resting. --> 00:07:08.160 And essentially what you do is you cycle your way through --> 00:07:10.680 all of your available slow twitch fibers --> 00:07:13.680 until you get back to the original recruited ones. --> 00:07:16.519 And the reason why your heart rate spikes --> 00:07:18.879 is because these original recruited fibers --> 00:07:20.680 aren't ready to go back in the game. --> 00:07:22.079 So what do you do? --> 00:07:24.120 You recruit a fast twitch fiber --> 00:07:25.560 because fast twitch fibers are better. --> 00:07:28.519 But now you've just rewarded. --> 00:07:32.000 These fibers that can't go back in the game --> 00:07:33.879 because they need more time to recover --> 00:07:37.439 and you just rewarded them for no muscular stamina. --> 00:07:39.720 If you want stamina, --> 00:07:42.439 these fibers have to go back in the game. --> 00:07:44.560 That's why faster is not better. --> 00:07:47.160 You took a slow twitch workout, --> 00:07:51.000 stamina building workout and turned it into fast twitch. --> 00:07:52.079 You ruined it. --> 00:07:54.680 And you know that when your heart rate spiked. --> 00:07:57.360 So here's the protocol coaches. --> 00:08:00.439 You tell the athlete as soon as that heart rate goes up --> 00:08:03.399 by that upper limit of five, you must walk. --> 00:08:05.720 Walking is fine because it's slow twitch. --> 00:08:08.040 You're going to walk until your heart rate --> 00:08:12.079 hits the bottom limit of zone two, 145 in this example. --> 00:08:13.759 And then they run again. --> 00:08:15.319 How can they run again? --> 00:08:18.399 Because as you are actually dropping that heart rate, --> 00:08:21.040 you're giving those slow twitch fibers more time to recover --> 00:08:22.519 to go back in the game. --> 00:08:25.720 There is a reason why elite marathon runners run --> 00:08:27.439 over 150 miles in a week. --> 00:08:31.399 Because they don't want 26.2 miles to be a stamina failure. --> 00:08:34.960 We do not want any athlete to have HYROX --> 00:08:36.360 be a stamina failure. --> 00:08:39.360 I always tell athletes, if you're out of shape, --> 00:08:40.840 enjoy being out of shape. --> 00:08:42.759 Go out and go easy. --> 00:08:43.600 Don't suffer yet. --> 00:08:44.840 There's plenty of time to suffer. --> 00:08:46.960 Enjoy the base building phase. --> 00:08:50.679 The protocol, what we must do in zone two --> 00:08:53.080 is use heart rate as a tool --> 00:08:55.759 to what is our muscles actually doing. --> 00:08:59.639 The goal, again, 20 minutes is the minimum. --> 00:09:03.600 What I want you to do is min max, plus or minus five. --> 00:09:05.840 As soon as your heart rate goes up by five, --> 00:09:07.399 you've lost the purpose of that workout, --> 00:09:08.840 and it's time to walk. --> 00:09:11.000 You're then going to run again --> 00:09:13.759 as soon as you actually hit that lower limit. --> 00:09:18.200 You do not count the 20 minutes with that walking. --> 00:09:20.320 It's a total of 20 minutes of time. --> 00:09:22.759 Now, once you get to 20 minutes, what do you do? --> 00:09:24.440 We're going to try 25. --> 00:09:26.240 And then we're going to go to 30. --> 00:09:28.360 My recommendation is keep those athletes --> 00:09:29.399 all the way up to one hour. --> 00:09:30.519 And that's the plan. Chapter: Summary Building a Strong Foundation: Zone Two Training While high-intensity training is crucial for performance, building a strong aerobic base is equally important. This section focuses on zone two training, a key component of any well-rounded training plan. Understanding Zone Two Zone two training refers to low-intensity, steady-state exercise that primarily utilizes slow-twitch muscle fibers. It's often associated with heart rate zones, typically between 60-70% of maximum heart rate. However, the primary goal is to train the neuromuscular system, not solely rely on heart rate as a measure. Benefits of Zone Two Training Enhanced Endurance: Improves the body's ability to utilize oxygen efficiently, leading to increased stamina. Injury Prevention: Builds a strong foundation by strengthening bones, ligaments, and tendons. Mental Toughness: Develops mental resilience and the ability to sustain effort over extended periods. Recovery Aid: Helps clear metabolic waste and promotes faster recovery between workouts. Implementing Zone Two Training Target Heart Rate Zone: Use a heart rate monitor to stay within the desired intensity range (typically 60-70% of max heart rate). Pace and Perceived Exertion: Combine heart rate monitoring with pace and perceived exertion to fine-tune your effort. Duration: Aim for at least 20 minutes per session, gradually increasing to 60 minutes or more as fitness improves. Active Recovery: Avoid complete rest during zone two workouts. Incorporate short walking breaks to maintain blood flow and prevent excessive fatigue. Progression: Gradually increase the duration and intensity of your zone two workouts to continue challenging your body. Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them Going Too Slow: Exercising at too low an intensity (zone one) will not provide the necessary stimulus for adaptation. Focusing Solely on Heart Rate: Relying solely on heart rate can lead to fluctuations in intensity and hinder training effectiveness. Ignoring Pace: Neglecting pace can result in inefficient workouts and missed opportunities for improvement. By incorporating regular zone two training into your routine, you'll build a solid foundation for high-intensity efforts, reduce your risk of injury, and enhance your overall endurance and performance. Remember, balance is key; combining zone two training with high-intensity workouts will lead to optimal results."

--> 00:02:16.759 So in this chapter, what we're going to do --> 00:02:20.840 is just get a familiarity of what --> 00:02:24.039 and how to define lactate threshold, --> 00:02:27.439 and then how do we actually implement that --> 00:02:29.080 into a training protocol. --> 00:02:34.159 This intensity, when we think about it, --> 00:02:36.599 if we take an athlete from seated, --> 00:02:39.400 where there's no muscle fibers being activated, --> 00:02:42.759 and we increase the intensity to walking and then jogging, --> 00:02:45.439 and we eventually get to that aerobic threshold zone too, --> 00:02:48.680 we have 100% of our slow twitch fibers being activated. --> 00:02:51.879 If we continue increasing our intensity, --> 00:02:55.319 then where we are getting our speed from --> 00:02:58.199 is in those intermediate or hybrid fibers. --> 00:03:00.639 These are those type 2A fibers. --> 00:03:03.759 When we get up to lactate threshold, --> 00:03:07.680 we now have 100% recruitment of our slow twitch, --> 00:03:10.960 but we also have 100% recruitment --> 00:03:12.439 of those intermediate fibers. --> 00:03:14.280 And that's the purpose. --> 00:03:16.360 What we're trying to do is we're --> 00:03:20.240 trying to create adaptation at this particular intensity --> 00:03:23.879 within that grouping of muscle fibers. --> 00:03:26.120 So how are we going to define it? --> 00:03:30.039 We've talked about doing aerobic threshold and using heart --> 00:03:32.000 rate, that 180 minus your age. --> 00:03:36.319 We've also talked about VO2 at a time domain of six minutes --> 00:03:36.960 and faster. --> 00:03:38.599 But what about this speed? --> 00:03:41.800 What we must realize is there's no formula. --> 00:03:44.000 A lot of people will throw in a formula, --> 00:03:47.800 but remember, this particular area, --> 00:03:51.719 your maximum sustainable pace is dependent upon your level --> 00:03:52.280 of fitness. --> 00:03:56.680 And you can grossly underestimate or overestimate --> 00:03:57.960 your level of fitness. --> 00:04:00.879 So this is where we're going to need --> 00:04:02.879 to take a different stance. --> 00:04:06.000 What I want you to realize is that we --> 00:04:07.960 have to have a test perform. --> 00:04:12.599 We have to have some way of understanding our athlete --> 00:04:14.680 and where they are now. --> 00:04:17.279 And the way to do it is the test --> 00:04:19.959 that I'm going to be providing, a 15 minute test. --> 00:04:23.639 And this test, if you do it in the movement of running, --> 00:04:26.040 you will actually be able to determine --> 00:04:30.399 a very, very close approximation of where --> 00:04:32.040 their maximum sustainable pace is. --> 00:04:35.439 For most people, they would define it --> 00:04:39.399 as somewhere around the maximum effort, that speed, --> 00:04:41.279 for 30 minutes that they can sustain. --> 00:04:44.759 Remember, it's the population that we're --> 00:04:46.959 working within the HYROX community. --> 00:04:49.319 These are not running specialists. --> 00:04:53.160 These are athletes that are looking at and utilizing --> 00:04:56.480 strength and recognizing strength matters in order --> 00:04:58.319 to get through the competition. --> 00:05:00.160 They're a hybrid athlete. --> 00:05:02.199 They work on endurance, but they also --> 00:05:04.120 work on their speed, strength, and power. --> 00:05:07.399 They're trying to manage the balance between those two. --> 00:05:11.680 So we recognize that this athlete isn't a specialist. --> 00:05:14.839 If you told the cyclist, back in my day, --> 00:05:17.720 I was riding 350 to 400 miles a week. --> 00:05:19.800 60 minute time trial is a joke. --> 00:05:21.040 But you know what? --> 00:05:25.240 Now, someone who actually trains both sides --> 00:05:29.160 and I do it in moderation, I couldn't maintain motivation --> 00:05:30.240 for 60 minutes. --> 00:05:33.839 So the reason why they're actually doing a 15 minute test --> 00:05:37.040 is because of the population that we're catering to. --> 00:05:40.839 Most people can maintain intent and motivation --> 00:05:43.399 and deliver performance in that 15 minutes. --> 00:05:46.759 Now, what's interesting is that a lot of people --> 00:05:50.600 will sit and say, can I possibly use my finishing time --> 00:05:53.279 to predict my lactate threshold? --> 00:05:56.240 You can if your finishing time is 40 minutes and under. --> 00:05:59.439 So if your total amount of time is 40 minutes and under, --> 00:06:01.519 then that's a very good approximation --> 00:06:04.439 of your lactate threshold pace. --> 00:06:07.879 Now, the question is coaches. --> 00:06:11.560 If we identify this particular speed for your athlete, --> 00:06:12.879 how do we train it? --> 00:06:16.639 Remember, the more time you spend at a particular stimulus, --> 00:06:18.480 the greater level of adaptation. --> 00:06:20.839 So there's two approaches. --> 00:06:25.439 One is a tempo type of an intensity, a slightly slower --> 00:06:27.720 intensity than what you just calculated. --> 00:06:29.920 But what we're going to do is unbroken. --> 00:06:32.439 We want to actually extend the length of time --> 00:06:35.120 that we can hold on to that particular intensity. --> 00:06:37.720 It is below your lactate threshold. --> 00:06:40.279 What we're doing is we're bumping up --> 00:06:43.600 against lactate threshold, but never actually going above --> 00:06:46.160 where there's accumulation of that acidity. --> 00:06:49.000 We're trying to get the muscles that --> 00:06:50.040 are being recruited and --> 00:06:52.000 utilized at that particular intensity --> 00:06:55.639 more comfortable with those high levels of acidity. --> 00:06:58.560 When we go above the line, what we're talking about --> 00:06:59.759 is actually intervals. --> 00:07:03.240 We're going to do an interval at that particular speed, --> 00:07:04.879 and then we're going to allow --> 00:07:06.399 an athlete to actually recover. --> 00:07:09.759 This is the approach, and I want you to think about this. --> 00:07:12.800 Let's just say you give an athlete 10 by 400 meters --> 00:07:13.800 at that target pace. --> 00:07:16.079 Give them a work to rest of one to one. --> 00:07:17.600 So if they do 90 seconds of work, --> 00:07:19.399 you're going to give them 90 seconds of rest. --> 00:07:22.319 The key here is their first interval is going to be easy. --> 00:07:24.759 It's going to be easy because they're fresh, --> 00:07:28.439 but then they're actually going to accumulate some fatigue. --> 00:07:30.120 They've got some muscular stamina issues. --> 00:07:32.319 What I want you to think about is --> 00:07:34.839 that probably the first seven intervals --> 00:07:37.079 is going to be below the line. --> 00:07:41.199 What we want is about that eighth interval --> 00:07:44.519 right on that line, and then nine and 10 are just above it. --> 00:07:46.360 What we want to think about in doing intervals --> 00:07:50.240 is bracketing the intensity around the line. --> 00:07:54.319 The majority is below, but the dosing of it is just above. --> 00:07:57.319 That way what we're doing is we're forcing that lactate --> 00:08:00.319 threshold under higher levels of acidity --> 00:08:01.959 to learn how to manage it. --> 00:08:04.240 What we call this is tolerance. --> 00:08:06.680 We don't always want to play it safe. --> 00:08:09.319 What we want is we want to challenge the muscle fibers --> 00:08:11.839 to learn how to tolerate acidity. --> 00:08:14.720 If you always shut it down and play it safe, --> 00:08:16.160 then you're going to need to play it safe. --> 00:08:18.800 What happens when the body gets and sees --> 00:08:20.399 these high levels of acidity? --> 00:08:24.720 It releases bicarbonate to neutralize or buffer acidity. --> 00:08:27.480 So if you go hard, you develop this ability --> 00:08:32.320 to help neutralize this acidity to allow you to go longer. --> 00:08:36.919 Remember, you don't want the athlete playing it safe. --> 00:08:41.159 We want to challenge the athlete to develop the extremes, --> 00:08:43.559 to tolerate acidity. --> 00:08:46.600 Now, I need you to recognize and this --> 00:08:48.360 is one of the most important pieces, --> 00:08:49.879 and we're saving this for the end- --> 00:08:55.480 athletes have two limitations that are available to them. --> 00:08:58.279 Every athlete and it's this easy --> 00:09:01.840 is your athlete in need of more speed, more strength, --> 00:09:02.279 more power? --> 00:09:03.759 Do they need to lift? --> 00:09:08.679 Or is it that in a movement, it is their stamina, --> 00:09:10.080 their ability to endure? --> 00:09:11.919 They just get tired. --> 00:09:14.399 Remember, your lactate threshold is --> 00:09:18.399 made up of the fatigue coming in and the fatigue going out. --> 00:09:22.639 It is the equilibrium of that acidity coming into muscles --> 00:09:25.120 and the acidity going out of muscles. --> 00:09:29.679 Your fast-twitch fibers create this lactic acid. --> 00:09:31.519 But here's the magic. --> 00:09:36.879 Your slow-twitch fibers, when that lactic acid is present, --> 00:09:39.320 sees the lactate as a fuel source, --> 00:09:41.879 meaning it helps slow-twitch fibers move. --> 00:09:43.840 And when those slow-twitch --> 00:09:46.159 fibers consume that lactate as a fuel, --> 00:09:47.399 you know what happens with the acidity? --> 00:09:49.879 It grabs the acidity and removes it from the body. --> 00:09:52.279 Imagine having a --> 00:09:56.159 hyperdeveloped, slow-twitch aerobic system. --> 00:10:00.399 What you will develop is an incredible ability --> 00:10:02.519 to clear fatigue. --> 00:10:05.519 That's why when you're looking at your athlete, --> 00:10:08.320 do they need more anaerobic training? --> 00:10:10.080 Or do they need more aerobic training? --> 00:10:11.399 Do they need more speed? --> 00:10:13.039 Or do they need more endurance? --> 00:10:15.600 What is limiting their ability? --> 00:10:21.519 Remember, you can't just shove more intensity in, --> 00:10:23.840 because eventually that acidity accumulates --> 00:10:25.519 and it shuts you down. --> 00:10:30.519 Athletes must recognize that your slow-twitch fibers see --> 00:10:31.960 that lactate as a fuel source. --> 00:10:35.960 And when it grabs that lactate as that fuel source, --> 00:10:39.080 it's going to take the acidity and remove it from the body. --> 00:10:42.960 You have a relationship in every muscle group in your body. --> 00:10:45.440 High intensity creates that fatigue. --> 00:10:49.000 The low intensity aerobic clears the fatigue. --> 00:10:52.320 That equilibrium, that balance --> 00:10:54.120 between the fatigue coming in --> 00:10:56.720 and the fatigue going out, is what we know --> 00:10:57.559 is our lactate threshold. --> 00:11:00.720 So remember, when you're applying stimulus --> 00:11:04.519 in your training protocol and the frequency of how you have --> 00:11:07.960 that athlete train, do you need an athlete like myself --> 00:11:08.960 with more speed? --> 00:11:09.840 I need more power. --> 00:11:11.279 I need a better finishing sprint. --> 00:11:13.039 I need to work on my obstacles. --> 00:11:15.279 Then I'm going to be above that line. --> 00:11:17.320 I need more high intensity training. --> 00:11:22.039 But for the athletes that actually are getting fatigued, --> 00:11:25.240 the athletes that say, what limited me to my ability --> 00:11:26.879 was, I just got tired. --> 00:11:29.960 Then what you need to do is more zone two. --> 00:11:31.639 You need to work what's below the line. --> 00:11:34.159 And that's what's going to determine your frequency. --> 00:11:36.080 Remember, athletes are different. --> 00:11:38.360 And they're different because of their physiology, --> 00:11:41.840 their genetics, and also their level of fitness. --> 00:11:44.759 And so as coaches, what we're trying to do --> 00:11:47.519 is determine what is it that they need. --> 00:11:51.320 And it is either more speed or more recovery. --> 00:11:53.279 And that determines your frequency. --> 00:11:55.519 But the three intensities stay the same. --> 00:11:58.120 We have that high intensity VO2. --> 00:12:00.240 Right in the middle is our lactate threshold. --> 00:12:02.399 And down below is our aerobic threshold --> 00:12:04.799 easy, moderate, and high intensity. --> 00:12:07.720 All right, coaches, good luck with this. --> 00:12:08.799 And thank you. Chapter: Summary Lactate Threshold Training: Core Training Intensities Understanding Lactate Threshold Lactate threshold represents the maximum sustainable pace before lactate buildup significantly impairs performance. It's a crucial factor in HYROX success, as athletes must balance high-intensity efforts with endurance. Defining lactate threshold requires testing, as individual fitness levels vary greatly. Lactate Threshold Training Methods Tempo Runs: Maintain a steady pace slightly below lactate threshold for extended durations. Interval Training: Alternate high-intensity intervals at lactate threshold pace with recovery periods. Focus on Muscle Fiber Recruitment: Target both slow-twitch and fast-twitch fibers for optimal adaptation. Balancing Speed and Endurance Individual Needs: Assess whether an athlete requires more speed-focused or endurance-based training. Acidity Management: Train the body to tolerate higher levels of acidity through lactate threshold workouts. Slow-Twitch Fiber Role: Recognize that slow-twitch fibers can utilize lactate as fuel, aiding recovery and performance. Key Takeaways Lactate threshold training is essential for HYROX success. Combine tempo runs and intervals to effectively target lactate threshold. Balance high-intensity efforts with recovery to optimize adaptation. Understand individual athlete needs to tailor training accordingly. Prioritize neuromuscular adaptations over heart rate-based training."

Chapter: Summary Muscle Fiber Recruitment Two Main Muscle Fiber Types: Slow Twitch: These fibers excel in endurance activities, relying on oxygen for energy production. They contract slowly but fatigue-resistant, allowing for sustained effort. Fast Twitch: These fibers are responsible for short bursts of power and speed. They rely on stored energy sources and fatigue quickly. Training for the \"Middle\": Optimizing Potential: Unlike sports that heavily favor one type of fiber (e.g., sprinting for fast twitch), HYROX caters to a wider range of athletes. The combination of running, obstacles, and weightlifting exercises within a single competition taps into both slow-twitch and fast-twitch muscle fibers. The Importance of Balanced Training: Neglecting either muscle fiber type limits overall potential. For instance, a slow-twitch dominant athlete who solely focuses on endurance training might lack the strength and power needed to excel in obstacle courses or lifting heavy weights during HYROX. Conversely, a fast-twitch dominant athlete who only trains for short bursts of speed and power might struggle with the sustained running intervals of the race. Maximizing Potential: By incorporating a variety of training methods that target both slow-twitch and fast-twitch muscle fibers, athletes can develop a more well-rounded fitness base. This translates to improved performance in HYROX and other endeavors by: Enhancing Endurance: Training slow-twitch fibers improves the body's ability to utilize oxygen, allowing athletes to run farther and maintain a faster pace for longer durations. Building Strength and Power: Fast-twitch fiber training helps athletes generate more force, which is crucial for tackling obstacles, lifting weights, and achieving explosive movements. Overall Fitness: Balanced training that incorporates both muscle fiber types leads to a stronger, more resilient athlete with a wider range of capabilities. Remember: If you don't train it, you won't gain the benefits. By strategically targeting both slow-twitch and fast-twitch fibers, athletes can unlock their full potential and achieve peak performance in HYROX and beyond."

--> 00:02:05.400 You need to be practicing that first 1,000 meter goal pace. --> 00:02:08.240 So if the goal is to do that first 1,000 meters --> 00:02:09.759 in four minutes and 30 seconds, --> 00:02:11.919 then that's the pace they should be practicing. --> 00:02:12.759 Now why? --> 00:02:15.479 Because you're trying to lock in that pace --> 00:02:16.879 so when the gun goes off --> 00:02:19.120 and they burn through that first 10 seconds, --> 00:02:23.240 they will settle into a pace that their body remembers. --> 00:02:26.960 Remember the purpose, the reason why we train --> 00:02:30.120 is the body learns from what we have done. --> 00:02:32.520 That's what's so beautiful about the human body. --> 00:02:35.479 You put a stimulus on it, we create an adaptation. --> 00:02:38.280 The warmup stimulus must be --> 00:02:41.560 their opening 1,000 meter target pace. --> 00:02:44.560 This is how you get that athlete --> 00:02:47.120 to lock it in sooner than later. --> 00:02:48.719 Why is that so important? --> 00:02:51.400 Because most performances are blown --> 00:02:54.120 within that massive acceleration --> 00:02:56.159 where athletes get caught up in the excitement, --> 00:02:58.960 they didn't practice the pace and they go out hard. --> 00:03:00.879 We have to control that. --> 00:03:04.360 That is the most important piece, control it. --> 00:03:06.280 So you will do a few intervals --> 00:03:09.000 and my recommendation is somewhere around --> 00:03:12.400 60 to 90 second intervals at that target pace. --> 00:03:14.520 Again, with full recovery. --> 00:03:15.879 We're not trying to do a workout here, --> 00:03:18.800 we're just trying to prepare the body for the start. --> 00:03:20.879 So get those in. --> 00:03:23.680 Now, afterwards, I want you to get the athletes --> 00:03:25.000 so that they're actually recovered --> 00:03:26.240 and they could take a break. --> 00:03:28.879 I would recommend that break to go over --> 00:03:31.360 onto another piece of equipment such as the SkiErg --> 00:03:34.919 or the RowErg, again, to kind of lock in --> 00:03:37.719 that particular pace that they want to identify. --> 00:03:39.159 Why is that important? --> 00:03:42.199 Because when you get to that SkiErg, --> 00:03:44.840 you're going to want to feel familiar with it --> 00:03:46.240 and the body will remember. --> 00:03:47.599 Why on the row? --> 00:03:49.919 Because it occurs so deep within the competition --> 00:03:53.360 that that's a place where an athlete can feel secure --> 00:03:57.599 to turn their mental, emotional psychology around. --> 00:04:01.199 It's a safe spot and they can lock that particular pace in. --> 00:04:04.120 After this, I would have them hop back on the runner --> 00:04:06.240 and warm up the neurological system --> 00:04:09.000 to tie everything together, to bring it from the head --> 00:04:11.520 all the way down the feet by doing a couple --> 00:04:13.039 of those 60 meter stride outs. --> 00:04:15.919 Here's the deal, all that has to be done --> 00:04:18.480 by the time you're about 20 minutes out. --> 00:04:23.240 That athlete is very important for them to have some time --> 00:04:26.439 to think about what they're about to experience, --> 00:04:28.720 what they're about to be faced with, --> 00:04:30.399 their own particular strategy. --> 00:04:32.800 The last thing that is good for an athlete --> 00:04:35.600 is they show up on the line and that gun goes off --> 00:04:37.000 and you know what happens to the plan? --> 00:04:37.759 Panic. --> 00:04:40.399 That will not happen if you give them --> 00:04:43.240 amount of time of 20 minutes and during this, --> 00:04:45.399 they'll be able to top off their energy systems. --> 00:04:47.279 That's how to do the proper warm up. Chapter: Summary Understanding and Training VO2 Max for HYROX Performance VO2 max, a measure of the body's maximal oxygen uptake, is a cornerstone of athletic performance, particularly in endurance-based and mixed-intensity sports like HYROX. By understanding VO2 max and incorporating targeted training strategies, athletes can significantly enhance their capacity for sustained high-intensity effort. What is VO2 Max? VO2 max represents the maximum amount of oxygen your body can utilize during intense exercise. It is influenced by factors such as genetics, training, and overall fitness level. A higher VO2 max generally equates to better endurance performance. Assessing VO2 Max A laboratory-based VO2 max test provides the most accurate measurement, but practical alternatives exist: Six-Minute Run Test: Estimate VO2 max based on distance covered. Lactate Threshold Test: Primarily for lactate threshold, but also provides VO2 max insights. Training to Improve VO2 Max Incorporate high-intensity interval training (HIIT) into your routine. Alternate short bursts of high-intensity exercise with periods of active recovery. Example workout: Eight rounds of 200-meter sprints with 100-meter active recovery. Gradually increase intensity or duration for continued adaptation. Prioritize active recovery to maintain blood flow and facilitate lactate clearance. Key Considerations Tailor training intensity and volume to individual fitness levels and goals. Balance VO2 max training with other aspects of fitness like strength, flexibility, and mobility. Recognize that VO2 max is one piece of the performance puzzle, alongside lactate threshold and other factors. The Role of VO2 Max in HYROX A higher VO2 max translates to a better ability to sustain high-intensity efforts. Improved VO2 max helps athletes push through challenging moments in HYROX. Combine VO2 max training with other training modalities for optimal HYROX performance."

--> 00:01:49.640 Because most of what is being done within HYROX --> 00:01:50.200 is running. --> 00:01:53.920 If you do a VO2 max test in the movement of running, --> 00:01:56.680 what you actually are doing is you're --> 00:02:00.879 getting the core information from that athlete of what's --> 00:02:02.599 occurring inside of them. --> 00:02:06.439 It's giving you access that you would never actually --> 00:02:07.319 be able to see. --> 00:02:12.400 The only other option to actually come up with paces --> 00:02:16.919 is by following some type of formula that is out there. --> 00:02:18.960 And this is, if you're trying --> 00:02:20.960 to create precision, accuracy, --> 00:02:24.319 in this athlete centered model, this is the way. --> 00:02:27.159 So in this test running, what --> 00:02:28.719 they'll do is you will wear a mask. --> 00:02:32.360 That mask is measuring your amount of oxygen coming in --> 00:02:34.240 and your carbon dioxide going out. --> 00:02:37.960 The rest of the missing oxygen is getting consumed --> 00:02:39.400 by your running muscles. --> 00:02:41.080 This test isn't telling you --> 00:02:42.960 anything about how well you row, --> 00:02:45.319 how well you ski, how well you pull a sled. --> 00:02:48.439 It just gives you insight into that movement. --> 00:02:52.439 Because remember, it's testing the moving muscle groups. --> 00:02:55.680 So they start you on a treadmill, --> 00:02:59.439 and they start you off on a low incline at a slow speed. --> 00:03:01.520 And they gradually increase the speed. --> 00:03:03.080 They gradually increase the grade. --> 00:03:06.479 And as a byproduct of that, your demand for oxygen goes up, --> 00:03:07.960 meaning your breathing rate goes up. --> 00:03:10.759 And your oxygen delivery system increases, --> 00:03:12.240 meaning your heart rate goes up. --> 00:03:14.680 And what happens is that the body --> 00:03:19.439 is reacting to the demand in the increased intensity. --> 00:03:23.159 They keep increasing intensity until your running muscles --> 00:03:26.680 no longer can utilize more oxygen. --> 00:03:28.280 And that is what your peak is. --> 00:03:30.159 Now, here's the deal. --> 00:03:33.919 Every movement has its own unique VO2 max. --> 00:03:35.680 It's always unique. --> 00:03:37.400 Think, for example, swimming. --> 00:03:38.800 You're prone. --> 00:03:40.759 There's no body weight being supported. --> 00:03:41.960 When you're hopping on a --> 00:03:43.240 rower, the reason why there's weight --> 00:03:46.439 is because you actually don't --> 00:03:47.879 have to support your body weight. --> 00:03:50.400 The object does that, but not in running. --> 00:03:53.520 And so in running, when you get a VO2 max test, --> 00:03:57.240 they divide your score by your body weight in kilograms. --> 00:04:00.719 This is what we refer to as aerobic power. --> 00:04:03.879 And that is actually something that --> 00:04:07.120 has been around since 1968 with the Cooper test. --> 00:04:11.439 We know that this information, and it's heavily researched --> 00:04:14.520 in order to understand your body's --> 00:04:16.519 ability to move and utilize oxygen. --> 00:04:18.839 But this is not a sustainable pace. --> 00:04:20.120 It is your peak. --> 00:04:21.680 Remember, we brought about Mount Everest. --> 00:04:23.120 This is your peak. --> 00:04:24.279 It defines your ceiling. --> 00:04:27.240 But this is important that we --> 00:04:29.279 recognize where our limitation is --> 00:04:31.720 as an athlete, because all of this --> 00:04:33.720 is what we need to create adaptation. --> 00:04:38.240 Now, on my test, you will see three different intensities. --> 00:04:42.040 As you move down that test, you will see that bottom box --> 00:04:44.920 on the very bottom of the second page. --> 00:04:47.040 On that box, that's my VO2 max. --> 00:04:50.240 You can see my heart rate that's associated with that. --> 00:04:53.199 Now, a lot of people, they --> 00:04:55.040 don't have the luxury or the desire --> 00:04:56.319 to do a VO2 max. --> 00:04:58.680 So how can we actually do --> 00:05:01.680 something to create a personalized VO2 max --> 00:05:02.480 for anybody? --> 00:05:08.079 Along with this module, you will get a document --> 00:05:10.279 that shows you how to actually --> 00:05:13.319 capture this information through a test. --> 00:05:14.839 And it is a six-minute test. --> 00:05:15.800 This is a proven test. --> 00:05:17.519 And what you're going to do is --> 00:05:18.959 you're going to go out and run for maximum --> 00:05:21.079 effort, and you will record --> 00:05:22.759 the total distance that you went. --> 00:05:25.040 You will then, from the --> 00:05:27.319 distance and that total amount of time, --> 00:05:32.240 incorporate what is your average meters per second. --> 00:05:34.639 That is your VO2 max intensity. --> 00:05:36.879 Now, coaches, how do we apply that? --> 00:05:40.279 Let's just say that you did 1,600 meters in six minutes. --> 00:05:43.040 1,600 meters in six minutes. --> 00:05:45.319 That's 90 seconds for 400 meters. --> 00:05:47.279 How do we incorporate that --> 00:05:48.920 information into a training protocol? --> 00:05:50.879 And this is what is terrific. --> 00:05:56.839 There is a proven, clear-cut way to be able to maximize VO2 --> 00:05:58.439 in a very efficient way. --> 00:05:59.879 And it is this way. --> 00:06:02.240 You're going to take that particular speed, --> 00:06:04.959 and we're going to incorporate it into a workout. --> 00:06:06.040 We're going to do a --> 00:06:08.160 high-intensity element at that target pace. --> 00:06:11.399 So for argument's sake, let's just say we --> 00:06:14.680 use that speed 200 meters in 45 seconds. --> 00:06:17.240 What does our recovery look --> 00:06:18.800 like after that 200-meter interval? --> 00:06:20.680 It's a high-intensity interval, right? --> 00:06:23.000 It's a speed that we could sustain for six minutes. --> 00:06:25.519 But the recovery portion matters. --> 00:06:27.680 A lot of coaches will think, I --> 00:06:29.160 must do nothing after that interval. --> 00:06:31.720 I'm going to give the athlete passive recovery. --> 00:06:33.279 I'm going to let them sit in a chair. --> 00:06:35.759 The problem with sitting in a chair is --> 00:06:38.040 you have created this beautiful adaptation --> 00:06:40.319 at that 45-second amount of time. --> 00:06:43.759 The heart rate is in that great, perfect spot. --> 00:06:45.439 And now we do nothing, and the --> 00:06:47.240 heart rate recovers, and it falls. --> 00:06:50.040 And the problem is it falls too --> 00:06:53.560 far away from the adaptation area. --> 00:06:55.800 We start the next interval, and how much --> 00:06:57.519 total time do we get in that sweet spot? --> 00:07:01.600 What I want you to recognize is we must actively recover. --> 00:07:03.040 We must jog. --> 00:07:06.639 The question really is, is what's the targeted intensity? --> 00:07:08.639 And the formula is simple. --> 00:07:12.800 When you do 200 meters in 45 seconds, the recovery is --> 00:07:14.959 always one-to-one work to rest. --> 00:07:18.519 If you ran for 45 seconds, your recovery is 45 seconds. --> 00:07:21.040 But what is the distance? --> 00:07:22.000 It's half. --> 00:07:26.079 So your recovery would be 100 meters in 45 seconds. --> 00:07:30.240 Training protocol is this-- 200 meters, 45 seconds. --> 00:07:31.439 You create fatigue. --> 00:07:33.319 That is a VO2 intensity. --> 00:07:34.720 And then what we're going to do is --> 00:07:38.120 follow it up with 100 meters in 45 seconds, --> 00:07:39.560 and that is your active recovery. --> 00:07:42.519 You will do multiple rounds of this. --> 00:07:44.120 Let's just say you do eight rounds. --> 00:07:47.240 The key in the adaptation and the progression --> 00:07:51.160 is more and more time at that VO2 pace. --> 00:07:53.079 So if you did a workout that --> 00:07:55.279 accumulated five minutes at that VO2, --> 00:07:57.319 the next workout should be more volume. --> 00:07:59.439 The holy grail in this type of --> 00:08:01.680 programming format that is well-researched, --> 00:08:04.720 well-studied is five rounds, three --> 00:08:06.560 minutes of work, three minutes of rest. --> 00:08:09.920 So in my case, it's 800 meters in --> 00:08:12.519 three minutes, and then 400 meters in three --> 00:08:13.600 minutes, five rounds. --> 00:08:16.399 I've never done it, but if you're --> 00:08:18.519 able to, you're at the holy grail. --> 00:08:20.800 All right, that's how you do VO2. --> 00:08:22.000 That's how you define it. Chapter: Summary A Deeper Dive into VO2 Max and Its Implications for Coaching VO2 max, a cornerstone metric in sports science, represents an athlete's maximal oxygen uptake. It's essentially the engine that powers physical performance, reflecting the body's capacity to deliver oxygen to working muscles. Key considerations for coaches: Individualization: Every athlete has a unique VO2 max, influenced by factors like genetics, training history, and body composition. Coaches must tailor training programs accordingly. Training Adaptations: Regular, well-structured training can enhance VO2 max. Interval training, in particular, has been shown to be effective in improving aerobic capacity. Monitoring and Progression: Coaches should track athletes' progress over time to assess the effectiveness of their training programs and make necessary adjustments. Complementary Metrics: While VO2 max is a valuable indicator, it's essential to consider other factors such as lactate threshold, economy of movement, and neuromuscular factors to get a comprehensive picture of an athlete's performance. Practical applications for coaches: Setting Training Zones: VO2 max can help coaches establish specific training zones for different energy systems, such as aerobic, anaerobic, and alactic. Assessing Fitness Levels: By comparing an athlete's VO2 max to norms for their sport and age group, coaches can gauge their fitness level and identify areas for improvement. Monitoring Overtraining: A decline in VO2 max can be a sign of overtraining, prompting coaches to adjust training loads or provide rest. Evaluating Performance: VO2 max can be used to analyze performance in specific events and identify limiting factors. In conclusion, understanding VO2 max is crucial for coaches seeking to optimize athlete performance. By incorporating VO2 max into training programs, coaches can help athletes improve their aerobic capacity, enhance endurance, and achieve their full potential."

First, we will explain Intermittent Fasting as a method to increase metabolic flexibility, including its different forms and benefits. Secondly, we will introduce the ketogenic diet in the form of a high-fat, moderate-protein diet. Both dietary strategies, when used correctly, can contribute to performance enhancement and health optimization. Specifically, reducing body fat percentage during certain phases of the training cycle, especially close to the main competition, plays a central role. Both dietary strategies also share the goal of optimizing metabolic flexibility. The central aim is to produce ketone bodies as an energy source or to induce a ketogenic state. The muscles, as well as the brain, should learn to utilize fats in the form of ketone bodies as an energy source alongside carbohydrates. Additionally, the sensitivity and efficiency of carbohydrate metabolism are optimized. Chapter: Intermittent fasting --> 00:00:09.880 Attention HYROX athletes and coaches, --> 00:00:11.440 are you ready to unlock their --> 00:00:13.679 secrets to optimizing your metabolism, --> 00:00:16.679 boosting your performance and promoting longevity? --> 00:00:20.119 Intermittent fasting might be the --> 00:00:23.719 game-changing strategy you've been looking for. --> 00:00:26.599 Let's dive into how this powerful --> 00:00:28.679 approach can transform your training --> 00:00:30.320 and competition results. --> 00:00:34.039 Intermittent fasting is often misunderstood. --> 00:00:36.400 It's about consuming the necessary --> 00:00:39.239 energy within a smaller time window, --> 00:00:43.880 helping to achieve a ketogenic state with benefits for a --> 00:00:46.480 flexible and powerful metabolism. --> 00:00:48.719 And this means that intermittent --> 00:00:51.920 fasting doesn't have to be done every day. --> 00:00:54.960 It must remain intermittent. --> 00:00:59.960 Intermittent fasting alternates periods of fasting and --> 00:01:02.320 eating within specific time frames, --> 00:01:06.280 aimed at weight loss and reducing chronic disease risks. --> 00:01:10.679 Benefits include improved cardiovascular health, brain --> 00:01:13.960 function and potential life-extending effects. --> 00:01:18.239 The most popular method is a 16-8-method, --> 00:01:20.800 where you fast for 16 hours and eat with --> 00:01:23.559 an 8-hour window all energy you'll need. --> 00:01:26.599 During fasting, the body burns, --> 00:01:29.800 stored glycogen and body fat for energy, --> 00:01:34.599 increasing AMPK levels in cells and reducing body fat. --> 00:01:38.360 The 16-8-method fits easily into --> 00:01:41.039 daily life by fasting overnight --> 00:01:44.719 and having an early dinner and late breakfast. --> 00:01:49.679 For example, fasting from 8 p.m. to 12 p.m. the next day, --> 00:01:53.920 while intuitive eating is allowed during the 8-hour window, --> 00:01:58.360 careful supervising is needed to avoid unhealthy patterns. --> 00:02:02.039 In high-intensity sports, performance may drop during --> 00:02:05.159 fasting due to low glycogen stores, --> 00:02:07.880 but endurance activities remain --> 00:02:11.559 unaffected as the body uses fat for energy. --> 00:02:17.159 Endurance training sessions of 90 up to 120 minutes can be --> 00:02:19.639 effective within the fasting window --> 00:02:21.519 enhancing fat metabolism. --> 00:02:24.400 For athletes, intermittent fasting can --> 00:02:27.079 improve the body weight to strength ratio, --> 00:02:29.719 boost the immune system, reduce --> 00:02:32.440 inflammation and enhance recovery. --> 00:02:36.599 Gradual adjustment to fasting and --> 00:02:39.639 careful planning of training sessions are key. --> 00:02:42.960 Embrace intermittent fasting wisely --> 00:02:45.639 for optimal performance and health. --> 00:02:49.960 Let's fuel our bodies right and achieve our best. Forms of Intermittent Fasting - Intermittent fasting comes in various forms: 1. The 2-Day Diet: (Two consecutive days of the week with a calorie deficit) 2. The 5:2 Diet: (Five days of normal eating per week, two days with approximately 25% of the usual calorie intake, following a fixed rhythm) 3. Dinner-Canceling: (Skipping dinner and consuming only calorie-free beverages on 2-3 days per week) 4. 16:8 Fasting: (16 hours of fasting followed by 8 hours of normal eating, practiced every day of the week indefinitely) Chapter: Ketogenic diet In the Keto diet, carbohydrate intake is drastically reduced and limited to 50 grams or 10% of energy intake. With a high proportion of fat in the diet, fatty acids are preferably used for energy production, and the level of ketone bodies in the blood increases (acetoacetate, 3-β-hydroxybutyrate, and acetone). Energy production via ketosis becomes prominent. When carbohydrates are not available for energy production and gluconeogenesis cannot synthesize sufficient glucose from lactate, glycerol, and amino acids, ketogenesis is initiated, and ketone bodies are synthesized (from 2 acetyl-CoA). This metabolic pathway occurs in the liver, and ketone bodies enter the cells via the blood, providing energy. Ketone bodies can also cross the blood-brain barrier, serving as an effective substitute for glucose. Excess ketone bodies are excreted via urine and lungs, and acetylacetone leads to acidic breath. The energy sources in a ketogenic diet are the body's fat stores, fatty acids from food, ketone bodies, and glucose from gluconeogenesis. After a few days of complete dietary change, ketone bodies are primarily used for energy production, although the duration of adaptation is individual. Particularly during the period of dietary transition and afterward, there may be side effects. These can include dehydration, gastrointestinal discomfort, and lethargy. Long-lasting side effects are rare, but hypoproteinemia, hypocalcemia, altered blood lipid levels, and gallstones may occur. Especially when aiming for fat loss, a ketogenic diet can be effective as it boosts fat metabolism and the low release of insulin activates lipolysis, allowing the body to tap into its own energy stores. Additionally, individuals often perceive a stronger feeling of satiety when following this diet, thus naturally establishing an energy deficit. However, when aiming for weight reduction, a ketogenic diet for a period longer than 6 months is not more effective than a balanced diet in an energy deficit. Therefore, a ketogenic diet is beneficial for a short duration of implementation. In sports, this is particularly useful when weight plays a role (weight classes, aesthetic sports, athletics). In these cases, a short-term ketogenic diet can significantly reduce body fat percentage without affecting performance and strength. Both for non-athletes and athletes, the ketogenic diet makes sense in the context of weight reduction or body fat reduction. Since no increasing effects can be expected with longer duration, the ketogenic diet is suitable for a short to medium period (approximately 30 days). The body's adaptation to the dietary change is individual, so the optimal duration of the diet may vary. With a detailed anamnesis discussion and professional guidance during implementation. The ketogenic dietary approach is particularly suitable for the phase of building base endurance at the beginning of the season and during preparation. Due to the natural fat metabolism pathway, the time with many aerobic training sessions is particularly well-suited to acclimate the body to the changed nutrient intake and achieve similar performance despite the transition. Low-intensity exercise boosts fat metabolism and contributes to achieving competition weight. During this time, anaerobic performance may be lower during high-intensity training due to reduced glycogen stores, which can affect training. Finally, it should be noted that protein intake also plays a role in a ketogenic diet and can positively influence weight reduction if approximately 30% of energy intake comes from protein."

Chapter: The influence of dehydration on physical performance Dehydration during exercise can significantly impact performance by causing a loss of water and electrolytes from the body. When fluid deficit exceeds 2% of body mass, several physiological changes occur, impairing performance. These include decreased blood volume, stroke volume, and skin blood flow, as well as reduced sweat rate and heat dissipation. Consequently, heart rate increases, core temperature rises. Adequate hydration is crucial for optimizing exercise capacity and sustaining performance during physical activity. Hyponatremia Hyponatremia can occur during sports or physical activity, particularly in endurance events like marathons, triathlons, or long-distance cycling. It can happen when athletes consume excessive amounts of water without adequately replacing sodium lost through sweating and is characterized by low sodium levels in the blood. During prolonged exercise, the body loses not only water but also electrolytes, including sodium, through sweat. If an athlete drinks too much plain water without replenishing electrolytes, the sodium concentration in the blood can become diluted, leading to hyponatremia. Symptoms of hyponatremia can range from mild to severe and may include nausea, vomiting, headache, confusion, and in severe cases, coma or even death. Hyponatremia is a potentially life-threatening condition and requires prompt medical attention. Preventing hyponatremia during exercise involves not only staying hydrated but also ensuring adequate electrolyte intake, either through sports drinks or electrolyte supplements, particularly during prolonged or intense physical activity. Chapter: Which fluids should an Athlete drink? To determine what exactly an athlete should drink, several factors must be considered. Whether it's before, during, or after the physical activity as well as the duration of the exercise, sweat loss, the osmolarity of the drinks and if the drinks are containing carbohydrates or electrolytes can all play crucial roles. Electrolytes As mentioned before, during exercise, the body loses significant amounts of electrolytes like sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium, through sweating. This loss can lead to dehydration and impair performance if not properly addressed. To replenish lost electrolytes and maintain hydration levels during exercise, it is recommended to consume sports drinks that contain electrolytes. These drinks are specifically formulated to provide a balance of fluids and essential electrolytes, helping to rehydrate the body more effectively than water alone. Osmolarity 1. A hypotonic solution contains fewer solutes, such as carbohydrates and electrolytes, compared to the body's fluids. Hypotonic solutions can cause cells to swell due to the movement of water into the cells. 2. Hypertonic solutions have a higher solute concentration compared to the body's fluids. Hypertonic solutions cause cells to shrink as water moves out of the cells and into the surrounding solution, which can further exacerbate a preexisting dehydration. 3. Most sport drinks are isotonic, because Isotonic solutions match the body's fluid and electrolyte composition, making them ideal for replacing fluids lost through sweat and providing a source of energy without causing gastrointestinal discomfort. The mixture of water, electrolytes, and carbohydrates can be quickly absorbed by the body and contribute to cell hydration. Pre hydration One of the foremost concerns for athletes is starting their training or competitions in a properly hydrated state. As a general guideline for pre-exercise hydration, athletes should consider consuming a portion of 300-600ml (around 5-7 ml/kg of body weight) as part of their pre-event meal, ideally around 4 hours before exercise. Additionally, an extra intake of fluid is advisable if feeling thirsty or if urine appears dark. Another beneficial practice is consuming a portion of 300-400ml (5 ml/kg) right before the event, ideally within 5 to 20 minutes prior. During exercise A common goal during exercise is to minimize fluid loss to no more than 2% of body mass. A good starting point for fluid intake during exercise is typically between 0.4 to 0.8 liters per hour, depending on factors such as exercise intensity, duration, and individual sweat rates. To be more accurate, there are various methods to plan and individualize drinking strategies. Sweat loss calculation If white residues form on the athlete's clothing or if sweat stains on clothing dry with white residues, it is likely that more than 50 mmol/l of sodium (approximately 1 g/l) is lost through sweat. In this case, and during exertion lasting more than 2 hours, dissolved amounts of sodium should be replenished. To estimate sweat loss during training, you can weigh the athlete before and after a session, ensuring they're minimally clothed and towel-dried to remove excess sweat. Monitor the fluid they consume during the workout and note any change in body mass. Planned Drinking Strategy Aimed at reducing body weight loss to less than 2% and mitigating any decrease in performance linked to dehydration. Drink to Thirst Strategy Aimed towards minimizing the risk of hyponatremia. This strategy is often suggested in guidelines for ultra-endurance events and may be more suitable, especially for slower-paced runners. GI Problems/Gut Training Exceeding an individual's tolerance for fluid intake can result in gastrointestinal discomfort. Therefore, it's important to train and improve tolerance to fluid intake, a practice commonly referred to as \"Gut training.\" This involves gradually increasing fluid intake over time in training to help the body adapt to larger volumes of fluid without experiencing discomfort. Post Exercise To ensure athletes start their next exercise session in a hydrated state (euhydration), it's essential to aim for fluid replacement equal to their body fluid losses. Athletes may need to consume more fluid than they lose, such as 150% of their fluid losses, along with electrolytes or a meal, to achieve fluid balance restoration. The most significant replenishment of fluid balance typically occurs within the first few hours of recovery, but it's crucial to balance fluid intake with gastric comfort and consider the timing between exercise bouts. Caffeine Consuming moderate amounts of caffeine can enhance physical performance and may even contribute to hydration. However, it's important to recognize that caffeine can also have adverse effects on performance. Alcohol Alcohol's effects can dehydrate the body, impacting sports performance negatively. Furthermore, alcohol consumption can disrupt sleep patterns, hinder recovery, and weaken the immune system, which further compromises athletic performance. Practice Tipps Start exercising well hydrated (euhydrated), consume sport drinks with small amounts of electrolytes and carbohydrates as a drink or mouth rinse during exercise. Rehydrate after Exercise. Be aware of your sweat loss and the impact of dehydration on performance. Chapter: Competition nutrition The nutrition in the immediate period before the competition is crucial for good performance. This applies to the last days before the competition, but specially to the nutrition on the competition day itself. This chapter provides you with a guide for an optimal nutrition strategy for the competition. Nutritional strategies for competition In general, special attention should be paid to a carbohydrate-rich diet before the competition. However, it is equally important to continuously meet the protein requirements and carbohydrate intake between and after training sessions to ensure optimal adaptations and recovery between sessions. Recommendations for carbohydrate intake 24 hours before the competition range from 7-12 g/kg/d. The so-called carb loading usually occurs only for competitions lasting 90 minutes or longer, with recommendations of 10-12 g/kg/d 36-48 hours beforehand. Recommended foods would be rice, pasta, sweet potatoes. Furthermore, on the day of the competition, it is advisable to avoid high-fiber foods, as these can lead to gastrointestinal discomfort, which could negatively affect performance. Fiber rich foods to avoid would be whole grain products and certain vegetables. The protein requirement should be continuously met through a protein-rich diet, ranging from 1.2-2.0 g/kg/d, to support muscle growth and recovery between training sessions. On the day of the competition, it is recommended to consume 1-4 g/kg of carbohydrates and about 300-600 ml of fluid 1-4 hours before the competition.To boost performance, the sports drink should provide approximately 60 - 80 g of carbohydrates and 400 - 1000 mg of sodium per liter. It is recommended to consume 500 ml of the drink one hour before starting to ensure that the stores are adequately filled in advance. For example foods that contain between 30-60g of carbohydrates, would be 2 bananas,1-2 gel, 2 bars or a bread with honey. Ideally, sugar compounds with different glycemic indices should be combined for gels or bars. This means sugar compounds such as monosaccharides and disaccharides together with oligosaccharides. A frequently chosen combination is glucose and maltodextrin. The maximum absorption capacity of glucose and also fructose via the intestine must be taken into account here. Glucose is absorbed via the SGLT1 transporter and fructose via the GLUT5 transporter in the intestine. In normally trained athletes, this can form the so-called bottleneck for the maximum possible intake of carbohydrates during the competition. The following formula can be used to calculate the absorption capacity: 0.7g/kg/h. For a man weighing 70 kg, this corresponds to a maximum amount of 49 g of carbohydrates per hour. On average, 30-60 g of carbohydrates can be consumed per hour. In well-trained athletes with an increased number of SGLT1 transporters in the intestine, up to 1g/kg/h can be expected. For a man weighing 70 kg, this corresponds to a maximum amount of 70 g of carbohydrates per hour. It is also important to consume fluids in addition to carbohydrate intake. Specific care should also be taken to consume sufficient water for osmotic balance. On average, this should correspond to a solution of 6-8%. A gel contains an average of 30 g of carbohydrates - depending on the temperature, up to 300 ml of water should therefore be consumed. Caution is advised with gels containing fructose. Our intestines have an even lower maximum absorption capacity for fructose. This threshold is around 50 g per day. An excessive intake of fructose can therefore lead to gastrointestinal complaints. In addition, fructose does not contribute optimally to energy metabolism or - if consumed without fruit - may even have a negative effect. This negative influence is caused by the pro-inflammatory effect of fructose in the body and promotes the formation of a fatty liver and the storage of fat in adipose tissue. This applies in particular to fructose intake outside of exercise. During the competition, fluid intake should be 0.4-0.8 ml per kilogram of body weight, preferably enriched with sodium to maintain electrolyte balance. Small amounts of fast-acting carbohydrates are also advisable, which can also be consumed through \"mouth rinsing”. After the competition, fluid balance and carbohydrate stores should be replenished along with a protein-rich meal containing approximately 25-30 g of protein."

In this pursuit, minerals and vitamins play a crucial role as they fulfill essential functions in the body that are crucial for athletic performance. These nutrients not only serve for energy production but also regulate a variety of physiological processes that are essential for muscle contraction, endurance, recovery, and immunity. The knowledge about the functions of minerals and vitamins is of utmost importance for athletes. They not only support the maintenance of health and prevention of deficiencies but can also directly influence athletic performance. A targeted intake of these nutrients can contribute to optimizing metabolism, accelerating muscle regeneration, increasing resistance to injuries, and strengthening immune function. Furthermore, selecting the right foods rich in these essential nutrients can significantly contribute to enhancing your performance as an athlete. The following sections elaborate on the diverse functions of vitamins and minerals, as well as list foods abundant in these nutrients to meet your needs. In the advanced seminar, we will thoroughly discuss mineral and vitamin deficiencies, as well as the precise intake requirements for athletes and specific cases such as special needs or illnesses. Chapter: Definition vitamins Vitamins are vital components of the body that cannot be produced by the body itself. The word vitamin is made up of \"vita\" (Latin for \"to live\") and \"amine\", a nitrogen group that is present in some vitamins. The functions of vitamins include controlling the metabolism of proteins, participating in the formation of the body's own substances such as enzymes, hormones, bones, blood cells etc., supporting the immune system and controlling numerous biochemical reactions. Vitamins can be divided into fat-soluble (lipophilic) and water-soluble (hydrophilic) based on their solubility. Fat-soluble vitamins require fat as a means of transportation and can be stored in the body, which in very rare cases can lead to an overdose. Water-soluble vitamins can dissolve in water and are therefore not stored in large quantities in the body. Excess amounts are excreted in the urine, so a daily intake is necessary. Chapter: Fat-soluble vitamins Vitamin A The fat-soluble vitamin A occurs in the form of retinol and is mainly found in animal sources such as liver, egg yolk, fish and milk. It also includes provitamin A carotenoids such as beta-carotene, which are mainly found in green vegetables and carrots. Vitamin A is crucial for various aspects of human health and development. The most important functions are to support embryonic development, body growth, visual function, spermatogenesis and the immune system by increasing the activity of defense cells and improving the immune response to infections. Vitamin D Vitamin D, also known as the sunshine vitamin, exists in several forms, with the two most important being Vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) and Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol). Vitamin D3 can be obtained both from food sources and synthesized by the body in the skin upon exposure to sunlight. Particularly good sources include cod liver oil and fatty fish. Vitamin D supports the immune system, reduces inflammation, and is crucial for bone health primarily through its role in regulating calcium and phosphate levels and promoting bone mineralization and hardening. Vitamin E Vitamin E refers to a group of fat-soluble vitamins sharing a similar chemical structure and is an important antioxidant in the body. The most well-known forms are tocopherols and tocotrienols. It is found primarily in high-quality plant oils such as rapeseed oil and in nuts like almonds and hazelnuts. Its key functions include anti-inflammatory properties by attenuating inflammatory responses, protection against cell damage, and acting as an antioxidant by scavenging free radicals. Vitamin K Vitamin K is divided into two main forms: phylloquinone (Vitamin K1) and menaquinone (Vitamin K2), both of which are significant for nutrition. These two forms are primarily found in green vegetables such as broccoli, spinach, and kale, fermented products, and poultry and beef. Its key functions include acting as blood clotting factors to stop bleeding and regulating calcium metabolism and bone mineralization. Vitamins Overview Vitamin A Function: Embryonic development, body growth, vision function, spermatogenesis, immune system Food Sources: Liver, egg yolk, fish, and milk, green vegetables, carrots Requirements: Men: 1.0–1.1 mg/day | Women: 0.8–1.0 mg/day Vitamin D Function: Immune system, bones, nerves Food Sources: Cod liver oil, fatty fish Requirements: 20 µg/day Vitamin E Function: Anti-inflammatory, protection against cell damage, antioxidant effect Food Sources: Rapeseed oil, nuts, grains Requirements: Men: 12–15 mg/day | Women: 11–12 mg/day Vitamin K Function: Blood clotting, calcium metabolism Food Sources: Broccoli, spinach, kale, fermented products, chicken, beef Requirements: Men: 70–80 µg/day | Women: 60–65 µg/day Chapter: Water-soluble vitamins Vitamin C - Ascorbic acid Vitamin C, also known as ascorbic acid: Humans rely on external sources of Vitamin C. It is found in both animal and plant sources, with plant sources containing significantly higher concentrations. Citrus fruits, berries, kiwis, and various vegetables such as broccoli, bell peppers, and green leafy vegetables contain high amounts of Vitamin C. Its key functions include protection against free radicals, strengthening the immune system, participation in collagen formation, and enhancing iron absorption. Vitamin B1 - Thiamine Thiamine is a molecule of Vitamin B1 and is typically found in low concentrations in the diet. It is primarily present in whole grains, nuts and seeds, legumes, meat, and dairy products. Its key functions include supporting the conversion of carbohydrates into energy, participating in the synthesis of neurotransmitters, and acting as a cofactor in energy metabolism for heart and muscle function. Vitamin B2 - Riboflavin Vitamin B2 is also referred to as the \"growth vitamin\" and primarily supports growth and development. It contributes to the health of skin, hair, and nails, participates in the formation of antioxidants, and supports energy production. It is found in higher concentrations in dairy products, meat, fish, eggs, and in relatively lower concentrations in grains, vegetables, and fruits. Vitamin B3 - Niacin Vitamin B3 is involved in DNA repair and cell regulation, supports skin health by strengthening the skin barrier, contributes to improving cholesterol levels, and is involved as NAD in the citric acid cycle, fatty acid oxidation, and in the respiratory chain. It is found in food sources such as whole grain products, yeast products, nuts, vegetables, as well as meat, fish, and dairy products. Vitamin B5 - Pantothenic acid Pantothenic acid is almost always present in its active form, coenzyme A. It is important for skin elasticity and regeneration, plays a role in cell division and growth, and is essential for the synthesis of fatty acids through its involvement in the citric acid cycle and fatty acid oxidation. It is found in foods such as meat, egg yolks, fish, as well as legumes, and grains. Vitamin B6 Vitamin B6 exists in various forms such as pyridoxine, pyridoxal, and pyridoxamine and is converted into its active form in the body. Its key functions include the regulation of numerous metabolic reactions, the biosynthesis of neurotransmitters, and participation in the formation of hemoglobin. Foods rich in Vitamin B6 include meat, fish, (sweet) potatoes, avocados, nuts, and legumes. Vitamin B7 - Biotin Biotin is involved in the energy metabolism by supporting the conversion of nutrients into energy. Biotin is considered a key enzyme in gluconeogenesis for the regulation of blood sugar levels. It also plays an important role in healthy skin by aiding in the formation of fatty acids, is important for cell growth and tissue repair, and is involved in the creatine metabolism, which is important for healthy hair and nails. Biotin-rich foods include eggs, dairy products, meat, fish, legumes, and vegetables such as spinach and broccoli. Folate - Folic acid Folate is present in many different substances. Its functions include the production of new cells and repair of DNA damage, as well as involvement in embryonic neural tube closure, which is why folic acid is particularly important during pregnancy. High concentrations are found in wheat germ, egg yolks, leafy vegetables, yeast, and whole grain products. Vitamin B12 Vitamin B12 also known as cobalamin, is found only in animal-derived foods such as fish, meat, eggs, and dairy products. Fermented products like sauerkraut may contain small traces of the vitamin, but they are not sufficient to meet the body's needs. Important functions of vitamin B12 include the synthesis of red blood cells, the formation and regeneration of nerve cells, and many other crucial bodily processes. Those most at risk for deficiency are individuals following a vegan diet who do not supplement their intake with supplements.

Macrominerals are those that occur in quantities of at least 50 mg per kilogram of body weight, while trace minerals are present in smaller amounts, less than 50 mg per kilogram of body weight (with the exception of iron, which is around 60 mg/kg BW but is still considered a trace mineral). The variety of tasks that minerals fulfill in the body is enormous and varies greatly from one mineral to another. Therefore, this module focuses specifically on shedding light on the most important macrominerals and trace minerals in detail to provide a comprehensive understanding of their significance for human health. Important macrominerals: Magnesium Magnesium is one of the most important minerals and is involved in all ATP-dependent processes (energy metabolism processes). It plays a decisive role in the regulation of nerve and muscle activity as well as the mineralization of bones and teeth. Wholemeal products, oatmeal, bananas, meat and fish are good sources of magnesium. A magnesium-rich mineral water is recommended. Potassium Potassium is the most important intracellular electrolyte and the antagonist of sodium. It also contributes to the regulation of the water balance, stimulus transmission and contraction and helps to build up ATP and store glycogen in the muscles. Potassium-rich foods are vegetables and fruit as well as potatoes and wholegrain products. Sodium Sodium acts as a counterpart to potassium in the body and plays a crucial role in regulating blood pressure and fluid balance by significantly influencing the pressure in the cells. Sodium is important for nerve and muscle conduction. Around 100 g of sodium is present in the human body and is mainly found in body fluids. Sodium can be easily absorbed through sports drinks. Calcium Calcium is found almost exclusively in our extracellular skeletal system and in our teeth and has a decisive influence on bone health. Calcium also plays a key role in various important processes in the body, for example in blood clotting and the initiation of muscle contraction, as well as in the regulation of nerve transmission. Calcium-rich products include kale, broccoli and various nuts. Important trace minerals: Iron Iron in the human body is divided into two forms: Functional iron and storage iron. Functional iron is actively involved in biological processes and is present in compounds that fulfill a specific biological function. For example, iron is a component of hemoglobin and myoglobin, where it binds oxygen and enables the transport and storage of oxygen. Storage iron serves as a reserve and is present in biologically inactive compounds. The largest iron reserves are found in the form of ferritin in the bone marrow, liver and spleen and there is a total of approx. 3-5g in the body. Iron-rich products are red meat, liver, oysters, soy flour and millet. Zinc Zinc, the second most abundant trace mineral in the body, plays a crucial role in numerous processes important for health. It supports the immune system, promotes the health of skin, hair, and nails, and serves as a cofactor for many biochemical processes in the body, including testosterone formation. Good sources of zinc include liver, oysters, eggs, and dairy products. Selenium Selenium is an essential trace mineral that plays a significant role in thyroid health by supporting and regulating its function. Additionally, it acts as a potent antioxidant, providing cellular protection, promoting detoxification in the body, and strengthening the immune system. Excellent sources of selenium include meat, fish, and various types of nuts. Copper Copper is an important trace mineral in the human body and plays a crucial role in various physiological processes. It is essential for iron metabolism and serves as a cofactor in the conversion of stored iron to transport iron. Additionally, it supports the function of antioxidants, promotes collagen synthesis for healthy skin and tissues, and is involved in regulating energy metabolism. Good dietary sources of copper include liver, fish, and shellfish. Iodine Iodine is mainly found in fish and iodized salt and plays a crucial role in regulating thyroid function. It is essential for the production of thyroid hormones T3 and T4, which regulate metabolism, thermoregulation, and many other vital processes in the body. Additionally, it is involved in controlling protein, carbohydrate, and fat metabolism. Chapter: Antioxidants A variety of vitamins also act as antioxidants. These chemical compounds have the ability to protect the body from free radicals, which can damage the body. Free radicals, among the most aggressive molecules in the body, are generated as natural byproducts of cellular metabolism or enter the body through exposure to environmental toxins such as cigarette smoke or alcohol. Their aggressive nature stems from their chemical structure, which results in an unpaired electron in their outermost shell. To maintain their own stability, free radicals seek to destabilize other molecules by stealing an electron from them. Antioxidants function by either donating an electron to free radicals or accepting an unpaired electron, thereby becoming radicals themselves. This process neutralizes the free radicals and halts their harmful effects before they can trigger a chain reaction. Examples of antioxidants include vitamins A, B2, C, E, as well as minerals like zinc, iron, selenium, and secondary plant compounds."

Chapter: Digestion of proteins We usually consume amino acids in the form of proteins in our diet. Our food choices provide us with the amino acids we need. In order to make these usable for the human organism, the proteins are first digested, the peptide compounds are broken down and the individual amino acids become usable for the organism. The metabolism of proteins begins in the stomach, where the large pieces of protein are broken down by pepsins. Further splitting into smaller pieces is carried out by peptidases (e.g. trypsin from the pancreas in the small intestine). The proteins are broken down into di- and tripeptides and amino acids. The amino acids are absorbed directly into the portal vein via the intestinal wall (small intestinal mucosa), whereas the di- and tripeptides are broken down into amino acids in the cytoplasm before they enter the bloodstream. Whenever proteins are broken down, more heat is released. This is also known as thermogenesis. This means that when proteins are digested, 30% of the energy absorbed is converted into heat and is therefore not available for further energy metabolism. This is one of the reasons why proteins and amino acids are not ideal as energy sources during exercise. Chapter: Biological value of proteins The biological value of proteins is used to assess protein quality and is defined as follows: The number of grams of body protein that can be replaced by 100 g of the dietary protein in question. This means that a protein with a high biological value can be converted to a high proportion of the body's own protein. Chicken whole egg is the reference value here with a value of 100. Biological value of proteins: Chicken whole egg: 100 Potatoes: 86 Pork: 85 Edam cheese: 85 Milk: 84 Soy: 84 Swiss cheese: 83 Tuna: 83 Beef: 83 Rye: 83 Rice: 83 Corn: 76 Beans: 72 Wheat: 58 In addition to the value of individual foods, the optimization of the value by combining different foods should be considered. This is because the combination of different protein sources in particular can increase the usability and thus the biological value. And in some cases this can be well above the value of 100: 36% whole egg + 64% potatoes: 136 60% whole egg + 40% soy: 124 86% whole egg + 32% wheat: 118 36% whole egg + 64% beans: 108 75% milk + 25% wheat: 106 56% milk + 44% rye: 101 52% beans + 48% corn: 99 50% milk + 50% potatoes: 92 77% beef + 23% potatoes: 90 Chapter: Daily protein intake and requirements The recommendation for protein intake in Germany is 0.8g / kgKG for adults under 65 years of age. Due to the high influence of proteins on training adaptation, a protein intake of 1.2-2.0g / kgKG is recommended internationally for athletes. Especially in phases of a new training cycle or for less trained athletes, this requirement may be even higher. The following general recommendations can be made Regular endurance training: 1.2-1.4g / kgKG / d Regular strength training: 1.7-1.8g / kgKG / d Strength athletes: 2.0g / kgKG / d The amino acid requirement results primarily from the need for essential amino acids. The daily intake recommendations for adults range from 4-5 mg per kilogram (kg) of body weight (kg) for tryptophan to 39-42 mg/kg bw for leucine. On days with intensive training, increased food intake with a high protein content should not only accelerate regeneration, but also achieve muscle growth in particular. A surplus of energy is generally necessary for this. This excess energy results in an anabolic metabolic state via the release of mTOR - a growth factor. Proteins, together with a high proportion of carbohydrates, support this signaling pathway. The growth factor mTOR is the antagonist of AMPK (see carbohydrate metabolism). AMPK is released in the so-called catabolic state - starvation metabolism - of a cell. In principle, HYROX athletes should also aim to alternate between the two cell states in order to provide the best possible training stimuli. See also the chapter on special diets such as intermittent fasting. Protein-rich foods are primarily animal products, which also have a very high biological value. However, plant-based foods can also have a high protein content and can have an equally high or even improved biological value when combined with other foods. This list provides an overview of the protein content of various foods. The list does not claim to be exhaustive of all available foods, but is intended to provide a good overview: Chapter: Essential and non-essential amino acids 20 proteinogenic amino acids are used to build proteins, some of which are considered some of which are considered \"essential amino acids\". These cannot be synthesized by the body itself and must therefore be supplied through food. A distinction is therefore made between essential and non-essential amino acids. The non-essential amino acids can be produced by the human organism itself. This means that the body can assemble them from other proteins or amino acids and thus make them usable. Essential amino acids, on the other hand, cannot be produced by the body itself. These amino acids must be supplied through the diet according to current requirements. There are also semi-essential amino acids. The body can form these itself, but this synthesis only takes place to a limited extent and the demand in the organism is often higher than the rate of formation in the body. For this reason, the semi-essential amino acids must also be supplied in sufficient quantities via the diet. Valine Valine provides energy for the muscle cells and sends important messenger substances for the nervous system. Contained in: Chlorella, spirulina, peas, chicken, whole wheat flour, cheese Leucine Leucine is involved in the formation and maintenance of muscle protein, provides muscles with energy and supports healing processes. Contained in: Chicken breast, peas, salmon, egg, walnuts, whole wheat flour Isoleucine Isoleucine is involved in the maintenance and regeneration of muscle tissue. It is also an important source of energy. Contained in: Chicken breast, peas, salmon, egg, walnuts, whole wheat flour Phenylalanine Phenylalanine is involved in the formation of numerous proteins and important hormones such as adrenaline, noradrenaline and dopamine. Contained in: Soybeans, pumpkin seeds, peas, poultry, walnuts, pork, salmon, egg Threonine Task: involved in the provision of vitamin B12. Contained in: Chicken breast filet, beef, peas, salmon, walnuts, egg, whole wheat flour Methionine Methionine supports the formation of proteins and fat metabolism. Contained in: Brazil nuts, salmon, sesame seeds, beef, egg, broccoli, peas, spinach, corn, millet Lysine Lysine supports the maintenance of connective and muscle tissue. It is also involved in fat metabolism. Contained in: Pumpkin seeds, chicken breast, salmon, peas, tofu, egg, buckwheat flour, walnuts Tryptophan Tryptophan can influence mood as a precursor of serotonin, known as the \"feel-good hormone\". Contained in: Soybeans, cocoa powder (unsweetened), cashews, peas, chicken breast Histidine Histidine is important for gluconeogenesis. The breakdown products of this glucogenic amino acid are used for the reconstruction of gluten. The carbon skeleton of histidine enters the citrate cycle via α-ketoglutarate, whose immediate precursor is glutamic acid. Contained in: Beef, chicken breast, salmon, chicken egg, cow's milk, walnuts, wheat flour, corn flour, rice, soybeans, peas. Chapter: Functions of amino acids in the human body This section is intended to provide an overview of the function of selected amino acids in the human body. In particular, we will look at the amino acids that have a significant influence on muscle metabolism during exercise, as well as those amino acids that particularly support muscle regeneration. We will also take a closer look at amino acids that can have a universally positive influence on regeneration, especially sleep, or whose deficiency can have a negative effect on recovery. As mentioned at the beginning, amino acids have different functions in the human body. Some amino acids are precursors of neurotransmitters or hormones. This therefore also means that a lack of certain amino acids can lead to a lack of neurotransmitters and hormones in the body. In the context of HYROX, the amino acids are certainly the first to receive decisive attention, as they support the repair function of the muscles and thus also the development of muscles. However, in addition to this function, the amino acids should also be considered in terms of their function for the other organs of the human organism. Only the interaction and optimal function of all organ systems in the body enable optimal performance. This applies to both training and competition. We should pay particular attention to training or, even better, the time between individual training sessions. Well-structured and optimally organized training is most successful if we also take into account the time between the individual units in hours or days when planning. The body's adaptation processes take place during the regeneration period. Our choice of food can either improve or worsen the recovery time. We should therefore choose our food carefully. Chapter: Regeneration and sleep A good night's sleep is the absolute prerequisite for an adequate effect of a training stimulus. Without restful sleep, optimal adaptation to training cannot take place. The semi-essential amino acid L-tyrosine is needed to synthesize noradrenaline and adrenaline. However, L-tyrosine is also necessary for the adequate function of the thyroid gland. Without L-tyrosine, thyroid hormones cannot be produced. L-tyrosine is produced from phenylalanine in the liver. However, if the liver is not functioning adequately, e.g. due to an excessive consumption of sugar (be careful with too much fructose over 50g/day) or alcohol, then the formation in the liver is not sufficient for the supply and L-tyrosine is no longer semi-essential, but essential for the organism. Fructose in particular, as a component of numerous industrial foods and sports foods, quickly poses the risk of liver overload and also intestinal overload. As the thyroid gland is the \"rest manager\" in the body and plays an important key role in the body's ability to regenerate as well as in energy distribution, this example is intended to emphasize the enormous importance of L-tyrosine as well as the optimal function of the liver and thyroid gland for athletic performance. L-tryptophan is an equally important essential amino acid for the regeneration period. The main reason for this is that L-tryptophan is the precursor of the happiness hormone serotonin. An optimal serotonin level is in turn crucial for maintaining the balance of cortisol and melatonin. Cortisol is our stress hormone, which keeps us awake and is mainly released during the day. Melatonin, on the other hand, is its antagonist and is our sleep hormone. For a good and regenerative sleep, we need a sufficient level of melatonin. L-tryptophan plays a key role here and should be consumed in sufficient quantities each day. The daily intake recommendations for adults range from 4-5 mg per kilogram (kg) of body weight (kg). Chapter: Important amino acids for muscle building and muscle maintenance Skeletal muscle consists of 35% BCAAs and almost 60% glutamine. The amino acids that are particularly important for muscle regeneration are the non-essential amino acid L-glutamine and the three consumable essential amino acids valine, leucine and isoleucine. Also known as BCAAs = Branched-Chain Amino Acids. BCAAs are important during intensive training, as they prevent the body's own muscle mass from being used for energy and thus prevent muscle breakdown. They also ensure more effective muscle building after training and at the same time promote fat loss. Among other things, BCAAs are involved in muscle building, metabolism, wound healing and tissue formation. A deficiency of individual amino acids in the BCAA complex can lead to fatigue and an increased incidence of colds. BCAAs cannot be synthesized in the body, they are only taken in with food. Valine, leucine and isoleucine are the only amino acids that are not metabolized in the liver, but directly in the muscles. This explains their importance in sport, as they increase the energy production of the muscles. BCAAs also fulfill the following functions: *counteract increased protein breakdown; are therefore used as an accompanying therapy for tumor diseases *are used for liver diseases *promote the maintenance and development of muscle tissue *regulate the body's energy supply *are a component of glucose production *stimulate the release of insulin and regulate blood sugar levels *maintain the body's nitrogen balance *contribute to healthy growth in children and adolescents Recommended daily intake The following daily intake of BCAA is recommended for healthy adults (in milligrams per kilogram of body weight): Leucine: 42mg Isoleucine: 19mg Valine: 24mg Sample calculation According to the above intake recommendations, an adult weighing 70 kg needs 2.9 g leucine, 1.3 g isoleucine and 1.7 g valine per day. These three amino acids can either be supplemented individually or in the form of a complete protein such as whey. That makes 5.9g BCAA per day. 3 of 12 Higher requirement for athletes Athletes in training sometimes have a higher requirement and should therefore supplement with 10 to 20g of BCAA per day. If athletes train a lot and do not consume enough amino acids through food or supplements, this can lead to a BCAA deficiency. Anyone who does not get a sufficient amount of protein in their daily diet should consider supplementing with BCAAs. Possible risk groups for deficiency BCAA deficiencies are relatively rare, but do occur in some cases in athletes. People who suffer from a vitamin deficiency (vitamin B5 and vitamin B6) or a glutamine deficiency (see also the topic of the gut) are also at risk. Vitamin deficiency A lack of vitamins B5 and B6 can also promote a BCAA deficiency, especially a valine deficiency. These two vitamins are also needed to supply the muscles with energy. If they are not available in sufficient quantities, the amino acids attempt to replace the deficiency. The result is an increased need for BCAA. More on vitamins in the corresponding chapter. Glutamine deficiency A glutamine deficiency, which can occur in the case of intestinal infections or stress, for example, can also lead to a BCAA deficiency. As a non-essential amino acid, glutamine is actually produced by the body itself. However, if the body's own synthesis is limited, it can also be produced from the amino acid BCAA as an alternative. This increased BCAA consumption can lead to a deficiency if the stores are not replenished. A good test for a glutamine deficiency is an intestinal test for the so-called leaky gut. The permeable intestine. In this case, glutamine deficiency leads to increased intestinal permeability. Symptoms can include chronic tiredness, fatigue and susceptibility to infections. Foods with BCCA The branched-chain amino acids valine, leucine and isoleucine are mainly found in protein-rich foods. BCAAs make up around half of the amino acids in food, so getting enough is rarely a problem. Plant-based foods with BCAA (Data per 100g of food) Wheat products: 0.9g leucine Peanuts: 1.2g isoleucine; 1.5g valine; 2g leucine Rice, unpolished: 0.3g isoleucine; 0.5g valine; 0.7g leucine Peas, dried: 1.2g valine and isoleucine each Walnuts: 0.8g each of valine and isoleucine Animal foods (Data per 100g of food) Beef fillet: 1.2g isoleucine; 1.3g valine; 2.0g leucine Tuna: 1.2g isoleucine; 1.4g valine; 2.2g leucine Milk: 0.2g isoleucine; 0.2g valine; 0.4g leucine Salmon, raw: 1.6g leucine Substances that promote BCAA absorption The three amino acids valine, leucine and isoleucine can be metabolized particularly well if the body also has sufficient vitamin B5 available. In combination with this vitamin, which is also used to generate energy in the muscles, BCAAs develop their full effect. However, if vitamin B5 is lacking, BCAA synthesis can also be severely impaired. Possible secondary diseases in case of deficiency A BCAA deficiency is extremely rare. However, if it does occur, it can lead to the following diseases and damage: Disorders in insulin production Changes in the blood sugar level Deterioration of the immune system High blood pressure Mood swings exhaustion Dysfunction of the liver neurological disorders Treating BCAA deficiency If you have been diagnosed with an actual BCAA deficiency, this can easily be remedied by eating a balanced diet. Beef, fresh salmon, wheat products, rice and many other protein sources contain plenty of BCAA. Athletes who have a higher nutrient requirement can supplement BCAAs with a complete protein. Whey protein (whey) has a particularly high BCAA content. The normal dosage for BCAAs is around five to ten grams per day, although athletes often take double this dose. Beware of overdosing Excessive doses of BCAA prevent other amino acids from crossing the blood-brain barrier and being synthesized into neurotransmitters in the brain. As a result, the body has too little serotonin available, for example, which in the worst case can lead to depressive moods and migraines. People who suffer from depression and other illnesses with low serotonin levels should avoid an increased intake of BCAAs. Preventing BCAA deficiency A balanced diet with sufficient protein, fish, meat and vegetables is sufficient to provide the body with an optimal supply of BCAAs. Vegetarians can prevent with plant-based suppliers Vegetarians also have plenty of foods that provide BCAA, such as peas, rice, wheat products and peanuts. During intensive training phases, it can also be useful to take a high-quality complete protein with a high BCAA content for an optimal BCAA supply. Chapter: Glutamine One of the essential amino acids is called glutamine and is significantly involved in building and maintaining muscle mass in our body. Glutamine is also the main source of energy for our intestinal cells. A lack of glutamine can also promote a lack of the BCAAs described above. A sufficient supply of glutamine should therefore be ensured, especially during intensive sport such as HYROX. Glutamine performs these tasks Glutamine is required for various processes in the body. The most important of these are: Glutamine is one of the most important nutrients for the cells of the immune system. It also promotes the formation of white blood cells, which specifically fight pathogens. Glutamine is also the most important source of energy for the digestive system. It provides nutrition for the cells of the small intestine and maintains intestinal function and structure. In the event of stress caused by surgical interventions or toxins, this ensures rapid regeneration of the intestinal surface. Glutamine also helps to speed up recovery from intestinal inflammation. Glutamine is significantly involved in muscle mass. It is the most important amino acid for muscles. It is particularly important for athletes. Furthermore, glutamine stimulates the release of growth hormones and thus supports the regeneration of the body (especially during sleep). Glutamine is also needed to build up messenger substances in the brain. Glutamine is also involved in the regulation of the acid-base balance. Excess acids can be bound in the body and excreted. Glutamine has an antioxidant effect, which protects the cells in the body The intestine requires the largest proportion of glutamine in the body, as it serves as the main source of energy for the cells of the intestinal mucosa. These have numerous important functions, including digestion and immune defense. Studies show that glutamine mainly helps with illnesses or damage to the intestinal mucosa. As a protein building block, it promotes protein production in the intestinal cells so that regeneration processes can take place quickly. In this case, between 5,000 and 25,000 mg of glutamine is recommended daily. Glutamine can also contribute to a rapid improvement in intestinal diseases such as leaky gut syndrome or Crohn's disease. For these conditions, 5,000 to 15,000 mg of glutamine per day is recommended. Additional glutamine is recommended for athletes. Although it does not promote muscle growth in healthy athletes, it does support muscle regeneration after exercise. With 4,000 to 20,000 mg of glutamine daily, athletes could: *reduce muscle soreness, *support the immune system during extreme physical exertion, *reduce the ammonia content in the blood, which leads to fatigue after exercise and *in combination with carbohydrates, improve the replenishment of their energy reserves Too little glutamine - these can be the consequences People with chronic and/or serious illnesses in particular often have a glutamine deficiency. This can be triggered by the following: *Chronic inflammatory diseases in the gastrointestinal tract *Liver damage *Heavy alcohol consumption *Extraordinary strain, high stress *Amino acid deficiency due to genetic diseases Further signs are: *Brittle nails *Dull hair and hair loss *Imbalance, sleep disorders and restlessness *Reduced physical and mental performance, lack of concentration and even confusion *Dwindling muscle mass *urine smelling of ammonia *Fluctuating pH value in the blood *Increased susceptibility to infections *inflammation of the mucous membranes *Wound healing disorder Other risk groups for a glutamine deficiency are patients with traumatic brain injury, chronic inflammatory bowel disease, severe burns, short bowel syndrome and people with blood poisoning, HIV disease and those undergoing chemotherapy. For example, glutamine is found in foods per 100 g (mg/100g): *Cheese: 3050-8100 *Peanuts: 5630 *Spelt flour: 5170 *Mung bean: 4810 *Soybean: 6490 *Lentils: 4490 *Mutton: 4300 *Beef: 4130 *Wheat: 4080 *Pork: 3910 *Chicken: 3500"

Chapter: Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids Polyunsaturated fatty acids are categorized into Omega-9, Omega-6, and Omega-3 fatty acids. A physiological advantage of polyunsaturated fatty acids over saturated fatty acids can be easily remembered by considering their respective melting points. Saturated fatty acids, like those in butter or milk, are very hard and have a high melting point, above our average body core temperature of 36 degrees Celsius. Omega-9 fatty acids, found in olive oil, have a melting point of just 10 degrees Celsius. Omega-6 fatty acids, such as those in flaxseed oil, melt at 0-4 degrees Celsius. Omega-3 fatty acids from fish are even more fluid. Imagine the incorporation of different fatty acids into the cell membranes in our tissues. The organism requires an adequate amount of polyunsaturated fatty acids for elastic blood vessels. Excessive consumption of dairy products and meat from factory farming leads to a decrease in the elasticity of blood vessels and ultimately brings further negative health consequences such as promoting the development of diabetes or increasing the risk of heart attacks in the long term. Omega-6 fatty acids, except for alpha-linolenic acid, primarily act as pro-inflammatory in the body. This isn't always necessarily bad. However, it is important to pay attention to the ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids in the blood. Ideally, this ratio should be no more than 1:4. Chapter: What does the Omega-3 Index describe? Polyunsaturated fatty acids are categorized into Omega-9, Omega-6, and Omega-3 fatty acids. A physiological advantage of polyunsaturated fatty acids over saturated fatty acids can be easily remembered by considering their respective melting points. Saturated fatty acids, like those in butter or milk, are very hard and have a high melting point, above our average body core temperature of 36 degrees Celsius. Omega-9 fatty acids, found in olive oil, have a melting point of just 10 degrees Celsius. Omega-6 fatty acids, such as those in flaxseed oil, melt at 0-4 degrees Celsius. Omega-3 fatty acids from fish are even more fluid. Imagine the incorporation of different fatty acids into the cell membranes in our tissues. The organism requires an adequate amount of polyunsaturated fatty acids for elastic blood vessels. Excessive consumption of dairy products and meat from factory farming leads to a decrease in the elasticity of blood vessels and ultimately brings further negative health consequences such as promoting the development of diabetes or increasing the risk of heart attacks in the long term. Omega-6 fatty acids, except for alpha-linolenic acid, primarily act as pro-inflammatory in the body. This isn't always necessarily bad. However, it is important to pay attention to the ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids in the blood. Ideally, this ratio should be no more than 1:4. The Omega-3 Index can be determined through a blood test. It measures the proportion of polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in the membrane of red blood cells. It reflects the body's omega-3 status over the past 4 months, similar to how hemoglobin A1C indicates long-term blood sugar levels. An Omega-3 Index in the range of 8–12% is considered optimal for maintaining the health of the brain, heart, and metabolism. As important players in the immune system, EPA and DHA regulate inflammatory processes; they have anti-inflammatory effects and help calm the immune system after a defensive reaction. During an immune reaction, pro-inflammatory substances increase first, including the release of arachidonic acid from cell membranes – an omega-6 fatty acid. This is necessary for the immune reaction to properly begin. This reaction can also occur conditionally after a tough and intense training session. All of our cells are surrounded by membranes – delicate shells made of phospholipids that separate the cell from the environment and selectively allow substances to pass through. What we eat significantly determines the properties and function of these membranes. Therefore, we have control over whether they are fluid, flexible, and functional, or rigid and limited in their work. Omega-3 fatty acids are also components of these membranes and are largely responsible for their flexibility. During an immune reaction – as well as after a tough training session or competition – these fatty acids are released from the cell membranes to unleash their immune-modulating properties. Receptor functions, such as the signal transmission of insulin and thus the uptake of glucose into the cell, also depend on a flexible membrane. The insulin sensitivity of our cells is crucial for a well-functioning metabolism. See the chapter on carbohydrates for more information. Chapter: Omega 6: Omega 3 – The Ratio Matters Critical for this delicate interplay of inflammation and healing is not only the amount of Omega-3 but also its ratio to the polyunsaturated Omega-6 fatty acid, arachidonic acid, which should ideally be at a maximum of 1:4. However, in Western industrialized nations, due to high consumption of meat, processed meats, and dairy products from factory farming, ratios of 1:25 or higher are not uncommon. When cell membranes are not adequately supplied with Omega-3, immune reactions are neither kept in check nor timely terminated. This increases the risk of chronic low-grade inflammation, which can, over time, drain energy and diminish training and competition performance. Chronic inflammation can be sustained for years due to lifestyle factors such as stress, unhealthy diet, nutrient deficiencies (Omega-3!), or lack of exercise, but especially due to overtraining (!). Similar to the embers of a fire, this inflammation smolders, producing harmful smoke and consuming vast amounts of energy. The responsiveness of the immune system becomes more rigid, the immune response stronger and less controlled. Energy for athletic performance becomes increasingly scarce. Chapter: Nutrition as Medicine It should be clear that it is important not only to supply Omega-3 in case of illness. The fatty acids must already be incorporated into the cell membranes beforehand to unleash their anti-inflammatory effects. EPA and DHA are essential fatty acids that our bodies cannot produce on their own. We must obtain them through diet. They can be found in fish, seafood, algae, and in smaller doses in wild game and animals raised on pasture. There are occasional claims that flaxseed oil or walnuts are rich in Omega-3 fats. However, these contain only the precursor to EPA and DHA, alpha-linolenic acid. Its conversion rate to the desired fatty acids is at most 5%, often only 2-3% in our regions. Unfortunately, this is insufficient for a good amount of EPA and DHA. Consuming fish, seafood, or algae at least three times a week provides a good foundation for supplying essential Omega-3 fatty acids and has a positive impact on regeneration. It's crucial to pay attention to the quality and type, as fish, especially large species like tuna, are heavily contaminated with heavy metals. The WWF fish guide can assist you in making choices. In case of a deficiency (e.g., due to existing chronic illnesses, unbalanced diet, stress, etc.), supplementation with purified fish or algae oil as a supplement is often recommended to restore the level to an optimal value. A healthy distribution of fatty acids is found in the following foods: *Rapeseed oil *Flaxseed oil *Hemp oil *Walnut oil *Omega-3 margarine *Nuts and seeds *Seafood (herring, salmon, tuna) *Olives and olive oil *Avocado Fats that should be avoided due to their fatty acid distribution: *Safflower oil *Sunflower oil *Vegetable margarine *Corn oil *Soybean oil Short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), including acetate, propionate, and butyrate, are metabolites of the gut microbiome that have important functions in the human body. Not only does the integrity of the intestinal epithelium depend on an adequate supply of SCFA, but systemic processes such as glucose metabolism and the regulation of appetite and satiety are also influenced by SCFA. Their determination in stool and serum can therefore identify new curative and preventive approaches. SCFA are produced by gut bacteria. Short-chain fatty acids are formed in the colon during the fermentation of non-absorbed carbohydrates, such as dietary fiber, complex carbohydrates, or resistant starch. The composition of the microbiome in the gut is crucial for optimal SCFA formation. The SCFA-producing bacterial genera in the microbiome are particularly important. By supplying fermentable fibers, these bacteria can be selectively increased, and their metabolic activity enhanced."

Chapter: Digestion of carbohydrates If carbohydrate sources are ingested with food, carbohydrate metabolism begins in the mouth. The enzyme amylase begins to break down the macromolecules in the oral cavity and is continued in the small intestine (small intestinal mucosa) by the digestive enzyme alpha-amylase from the pancreas. Each sugar is completely broken down into its individual compounds down to the smallest compound, glucose. The glucose is absorbed in the small intestine via the SGLT1 transporter and passed on to the blood via GLUT-2 transporters. Fructose is absorbed in the intestine via GLUT-5 transporters. The increased blood glucose level also stimulates the GLUT-2 transporters of the pancreas and thus the release of insulin, which in turn stimulates the relocation of the GLUT-4 transporters to the plasma membrane of the muscle cells via insulin receptors in the cell membrane and enables glucose uptake. However, the glucose transporter also shifts during increased physical activity, which ensures the supply of energy to the muscle despite low insulin levels. The calcium concentration in the cell and the plasma level of AMPK play a particularly important role here. The role of AMPK and its antagonist mTOR in particular will be dealt with separately in the section on intermittent fasting. Glucose from food is metabolized to ATP in two stages, both aerobically and anaerobically. In this process, 1 g of carbohydrates has an energy value of 4 kcal. Chapter: Storage of carbohydrates A high concentration of insulin in the blood stimulates glycogen synthesis and is associated with reduction in blood glucose levels: the glucose that is not directly metabolized can be synthesized into glycogen in the hepatocytes of the liver and the myocytes of the skeletal muscles. Glycogen is used to provide energy during anaerobic stress phases and is often used as an energy store for \"final sprints\". During long periods of endurance exercise, the aim is not to use glycogen stores exclusively for energy production. The oxidation of fat plays a key role here. It is particularly important to note that the storage capacity of glycogen in the liver and muscles is limited and therefore not infinitely available during athletic performance. Approx. 410 kcal can be stored in the liver and approx. 1230-2050 kcal in the muscles. In grams, this is between 350-700g in the muscles, 80-120g in the liver and 4-5g in the bloodstream. In particular, the storage capacity as well as the replenishment of glycogen in the muscles depends on the endurance training status as well as the immediate diet on the days before the competition. A permanently low-carbohydrate diet can quickly lead to a reduction in storage capacity, whereas a temporary low-carbohydrate diet with accompanying training and a subsequent high-carbohydrate diet leads to an optimized replenishment of glycogen stores. However, it is important to know that only the glycogen of the working muscles is available for athletic performance. HYROX is a full-body sport, but running takes up at least 50% of the competition time. For doubles it is even up to 70%. The aerobic part of the metabolism in running is the highest compared to most other workouts. Optimizing the glycogen stores in the running-specific muscles is therefore the basis for an optimal competition result. This increase in storage capacity can only be achieved by running itself. Insulin is a peptide hormone from the pancreas and the natural antagonist of glucagon. Glucagon is a hormone from the liver that causes blood sugar levels to rise. Insulin binds to corresponding receptors on the cell surface of liver, muscle and fatty tissue and accelerates glucose uptake (as well as amino acid, triglyceride and potassium uptake) into the cells. The release of insulin stimulates glycogen synthesis, which stores the \"excess\" food energy in the muscles and liver. Insulin has a particularly inhibitory effect on gluconeogenesis in the liver and lipolysis (mobilization of the body's own fat). Due to its muscle-building properties, insulin is also misused as an anabolic agent. An excess of insulin in the blood can cause hypoglycemia, which can lead to unconsciousness and death. For this reason, when training clients with type 1 diabetes, blood glucose levels must be checked regularly and communication regarding the administration of insulin is essential. Carbohydrates are the body's primary source of energy and provide athletes with sufficient energy during exercise. As the glycogen storage capacity of the liver (approx. 410 kcal) and muscles (approx. 1230-2050 kcal) is limited, the stores are only sufficient for a duration of 75-90 minutes during anaerobic exercise. Despite strategies such as \"carbohydrate loading\" or increasing carbohydrate intake in the week before the competition (with a simultaneous reduction in training) to replenish glycogen stores, the intake of carbohydrate combinations during long (>90 minutes) endurance exercise is recommended. In order to prevent hypoglycemia (low blood sugar levels) during exercise and the resulting drop in performance or even termination of exercise and to ensure optimum performance over the entire exercise period, a certain amount of carbohydrates should be consumed over the exercise period of more than 90 minutes. It is also known that a combination of different carbohydrates and their transport mechanisms can be beneficial during prolonged exercise lasting over 2.5 hours. Chapter: The path of glucose into the cell Let's take a closer look at the pathway of glucose from the blood into the muscle cell. There are three different ways in which glucose enters the cell. These three pathways can be differentiated as \"push\", \"pull\" and \"by contraction\": \"Push\" describes the pathway via the hormone insulin. This hormone, which is secreted by the pancreatic Langhan cells, activates the GLUT4 transporters to become membrane-bound by docking onto the insulin receptors of the cell membrane and thus transporting the blood glucose into the muscle cell. This pathway is therefore dependent on insulin on the one hand and on the sensitivity of the cells' insulin receptors and their number on the other. In the case of insulin resistance (precursor to type 2 diabetes), for example, the sensitivity or already the number of insulin receptors may have decreased. This makes it more difficult or, in the worst case, even completely blocks the pathway for insulin to get the blood sugar into the cell. Triggers for this can include a high food frequency, stress or an activated immune system. \"Pull\" describes the path of sugar into the cell with the help of activated AMP-kinase (AMPK). The concentration of the AMPK-protein in the muscle cell increases as soon as a certain energy emergency is reached in the cell. This can occur as a result of sporting activity or a longer period of fasting, as with intermittent fasting. This AMPK activity also leads to GLUT4 transporters being synthesized in the cell membrane, allowing sugar to enter the cell independently of insulin. A fasting period of 12 hours (preferably 18 hours) already leads to an increase in the formation of insulin receptors and therefore the \"push\" pathway works better again. \"Contraction\" - Muscle contraction can also lead to the GLUT4 transporters becoming membrane-bound. The glucose transporters are pushed into the membrane by the muscle contraction. This pathway of glucose uptake into the muscle cell is therefore also independent of insulin and insulin receptors. It becomes clear that particularly the insulin-independent pathways \"pull\" and \"contraction\" play a crucial role in glucose uptake into the muscle cell. The independence from the hormone insulin leads to a significantly improved flexibility of the muscle cell for the uptake of energy in the form of glucose and thus to a possible performance enhancement in competition. But also from a purely health perspective, this is of enormous importance regarding the significantly reduced potential for the development of insulin resistance, the precursor to type 2 diabetes, as well as type 2 diabetes itself. Chapter: Good sources of carbohydrates The glycemic index plays an important role in the choice of carbohydrate-rich foods and the choice of the optimum time for food intake. The glycemic index is defined as the area under the blood glucose curve after consuming 50 g of carbohydrates from various foods compared to the increase with 50 g of pure glucose. It therefore reflects the effect that the corresponding food or a specific sugar compound has on blood sugar. The glycaemic index is expressed as a percentage. Low: <55%, moderate: 55-70%, high: 70-100%. Here are a few examples: *Glucose = 100 *Sucrose = approx. 60 *Spaghetti = approx. 50 *Legumes = approx. 30 The main sources of carbohydrates are fruit, cereal products, potatoes, pulses and vegetables. Other important criteria when choosing foods are the fiber, vitamin, mineral and trace element content, the content of important secondary plant substances and the glycemic load of a food. The glycaemic load not only takes into account the quality of the carbohydrate source, but also the quantity in the corresponding food (GI*CH g per 100 g LM). In other words, how high the proportion of carbohydrates in the selected food is. Both should be taken into account when making a choice and are always in the context of the time of food intake. Some examples in comparison with regard to glycemic index, glycemic load and the proportion of carbohydrates in the food: Food: Carrots (cooked) GI: 32 GL: 1 CH/100g: 3.6 Food: Beetroot GI: 64 GL: 4 CH/100g: 6.1 Food: Potatoes (cooked) GI: 73 GL: 10 CH/100g: 14.2 Food: Apple GI: 32 GL: 5 CH/100g: 14.4 Food: Banana GI: 47 GL: 10 CH/100g: 21.4 Food: Sweet potato (baked) GI: 88 GL: 21 CH/100g: 24.1 Food: Whole grain bread GI: 40 GL: 18 CH/100g: 45 Food: White bread GI: 70 GL: 39 CH/100g: 55.4 Food: Oatmeal GI: 40 GL: 23 CH/100g: 58.7 Food: Dates (dried) GI: 54 GL: 37 CH/100g: 66.1 Food: Spaghetti (lightly cooked) GI: 40 GL: 40 CH/100g: 75"

Why does running feel more like bouncing forward rather than pushing a car? Fredrik will answer these questions and provide practical tips to help you reduce your contact time for more efficient running.WEBVTT --> 00:00:10.359 I have already mentioned the contact time. --> 00:00:13.599 That is the time you have the foot on the ground. --> 00:00:17.600 And this is a very important thing when it comes to running --> 00:00:20.519 efficiency. This is mainly due to a rubber --> 00:00:24.199 band effect that is in your body, it's built in, it's also --> 00:00:26.440 called the Stretch Shortening Cycle. --> 00:00:28.839 And the Stretch Shortening Cycle works --> 00:00:31.559 like, well, a rubber band, that's what I said. --> 00:00:36.079 So when you land, for instance, the body gets --> 00:00:38.359 compressed a little bit, and a lot of body --> 00:00:42.560 parts, tendons, muscles, fascia, gets pulled out and is --> 00:00:45.039 then, just like rubber bands, charged with --> 00:00:49.200 energy that you can have a \"BOW!\", a rubber band effect and --> 00:00:50.960 you get an energy return. --> 00:00:55.520 You get an elastic recoil and with a better elastic recoil, --> 00:00:58.280 better energy return from the rubber band system, --> 00:01:03.399 you will have to work less with your muscles. If we, for --> 00:01:05.400 instance, say that it costs this much --> 00:01:11.000 energy to take one step, if this much is made of the energy --> 00:01:12.920 return you get from your rubber bands, --> 00:01:17.040 the rest you have to do with your muscles. So if you get --> 00:01:20.480 this much energy return, you have to work --> 00:01:25.599 less with your muscles. How much energy return you get from --> 00:01:27.680 this rubber band system, it depends --> 00:01:31.560 on a lot of things. One of the main things is the contact --> 00:01:34.959 time. The shorter the contact time, the --> 00:01:38.560 shorter time you have your foot on the ground, the more --> 00:01:41.079 energy return you get from the Stretch --> 00:01:44.760 Shortening Cycle. And if you want to run as fast and --> 00:01:47.359 efficient as possible, it is important to have --> 00:01:52.280 a big energy return. I know this is kind of abstract, this --> 00:01:54.640 rubber band thing, but there is a --> 00:01:59.400 great way to showing your athletes how it actually works so --> 00:02:01.519 they can feel the rubber band effects. --> 00:02:06.879 You just tell them to jump up and down like this at about --> 00:02:09.800 this pace. Well, you can try it yourself --> 00:02:13.639 right now. Just stand up if you're sitting down and jump up --> 00:02:16.120 and down at this pace. This is not --> 00:02:20.800 hard. This is very easy, I hope. Otherwise you have to --> 00:02:22.039 train your calves a little bit more. --> 00:02:28.800 But what happens if we jump up and down slower at this --> 00:02:35.439 pace? It gets a lot harder. And if we increase --> 00:02:39.840 the pace a bit, it gets a bit easier. And if we increase --> 00:02:42.039 the pace a little bit more, it's very --> 00:02:46.360 easy to bounce up and down. And that is how the rubber band --> 00:02:49.000 effect works. Because when I jumped at --> 00:02:54.000 the slower pace, my foot was on the ground for a longer --> 00:02:56.800 time. And the longer time my foot is on the --> 00:03:00.599 ground, the less energy return. And that is also how --> 00:03:04.919 running works. Running is a bounce. You bounce --> 00:03:10.719 forward. It's not like pushing a car forward. It's not an --> 00:03:12.759 active thing with your muscles. --> 00:03:17.080 It is a bounce. So what's the best thing to do to have --> 00:03:20.199 short contact time then? Well, first of all, --> 00:03:25.879 no over striding please. Because when you put your feet way --> 00:03:28.039 in front of you, it takes a lot --> 00:03:32.120 of time to move it back here and lift. Instead of landing --> 00:03:34.400 here, a shorter amount of time. --> 00:03:50.840 So the over stride is not only bad because of the risk of --> 00:03:53.599 increased braking forces. You will also --> 00:03:57.280 have a longer contact time, which will make the energy --> 00:03:59.080 return from the rubber band system, --> 00:04:02.879 the Stretch Shortening Cycle, be less. And we want a lot --> 00:04:04.840 of energy return. And another thing --> 00:04:09.759 is the leaning. Or perhaps I would say where you have your --> 00:04:12.280 hip. A lot of people have their hip --> 00:04:17.040 a little bit too much back like this. And if this is --> 00:04:19.560 leaning or if the hip is back, I don't care. --> 00:04:23.680 But when the hip is too much behind the feet, the contact --> 00:04:27.439 time gets longer. And that's why it's so --> 00:04:32.680 super important to get the hip up on the feet because that --> 00:04:34.279 will make the contact time shorter --> 00:04:39.000 and you will have a lot more of the energy return. So how --> 00:04:41.839 much energy return can you have then? Well, --> 00:04:47.879 you can have up to about 50% of the energy that is stored --> 00:04:50.439 in these elastic structures in your body --> 00:04:54.519 you can have in return. And I have met some runners that --> 00:04:57.040 are very good at this and they have an energy --> 00:05:02.680 return about 49%. You can't have 50% or more. That's --> 00:05:08.279 impossible. So up to 50% roughly. But I also met --> 00:05:11.759 a lot of runners that have an energy return of just you --> 00:05:16.439 know 3, 4, 5, 6%. And that is not so much. --> 00:05:20.879 So then they have to work a lot harder with their muscles. --> 00:05:24.360 It's a huge difference in efficiency and --> 00:05:27.600 speed and how hard you think it is if --> 00:05:33.000 you get an energy return about 6% or 40%."

Fredrik will answer these questions and more, helping you understand the physics behind effective running techniques. --> 00:00:10.560 Now let's talk about the arms and the shoulders. --> 00:00:12.839 And they are super important. --> 00:00:14.279 First, a big surprise. --> 00:00:17.480 Your leg moves when you run. --> 00:00:21.440 I know, that was quite a surprise, right? --> 00:00:24.760 But this is all about physics and balance. --> 00:00:27.800 The body loves to have you in balance. --> 00:00:32.880 So, if the legs are moving as they do when you run, --> 00:00:38.359 preferably something above the waist has to move also --> 00:00:41.359 to counterbalance that the legs are moving. --> 00:00:44.280 So what is supposed to move above the waistline? --> 00:00:47.520 Well, people normally have two choices. --> 00:00:50.759 One choice is to have a good --> 00:00:53.880 movement in the shoulder joint, like this. --> 00:00:59.719 Now I can balance my legs. --> 00:01:05.560 Or I can start to rotate the upper body like this. --> 00:01:09.319 It has to be one or the other. --> 00:01:13.519 You can't be still up here as long as the legs are moving. --> 00:01:15.400 Well, of course you can be still, --> 00:01:17.359 but then you have to use a lot of force --> 00:01:20.599 and you will just be tired with all tensioning of the --> 00:01:22.120 muscles to try to keep it still. --> 00:01:25.040 A lot of people think that they move --> 00:01:28.400 their arms in the shoulder joints like this, --> 00:01:31.000 but they normally don't. --> 00:01:36.000 It's like 95% of the people I meet don't have a sufficient --> 00:01:38.079 movement in the shoulder joint. --> 00:01:41.239 Instead, they move like this. --> 00:01:44.760 I'm running like this and I'm moving my arms. --> 00:01:54.239 And what happens when you start turning the body? --> 00:01:58.040 Well, there's a lot of things happening. --> 00:02:00.760 First of all, if you want to have the --> 00:02:03.319 cadence a little bit higher than you have today, --> 00:02:06.680 this will of course affect the cadence. --> 00:02:09.719 It takes a long time to move this --> 00:02:12.960 much mass, turning the body like this, --> 00:02:15.319 compared to this. --> 00:02:18.599 And the pace you move your arm is --> 00:02:20.240 the pace you will move your legs. --> 00:02:33.879 And some people have their elbows too far back. --> 00:02:38.879 The upper arm is leaning backward all the time like this. --> 00:02:44.080 Another thing is that if you measure --> 00:02:48.120 how your central mass is moved laterally, --> 00:02:50.319 you will see that if you don't have a --> 00:02:52.439 sufficient movement in your shoulder joint, --> 00:02:56.439 you will rotate your body and then your central mass will --> 00:03:00.039 start to move more and faster sideways, --> 00:03:03.680 which makes you leaking energy sideways. --> 00:03:06.319 And these side weight forces, the lateral --> 00:03:09.080 forces, will also of course affect your hips --> 00:03:11.280 and your knees for instance, which --> 00:03:13.520 makes the end of your wrist go up. --> 00:03:19.360 So pain in a hip can come from big lateral forces in the --> 00:03:21.719 hip that comes from a non sufficient --> 00:03:24.639 movement in the shoulder joint running --> 00:03:27.879 like this, which makes the central mass move, --> 00:03:29.599 which makes the lateral forces --> 00:03:32.360 big in the hip and you get the pain. --> 00:03:35.240 Here you can see how adjusting the movement over the --> 00:03:37.879 shoulder affects a runner's lateral forces. --> 00:03:41.439 The larger light-colored arrow shows the --> 00:03:44.159 lateral forces at the runner's first test. --> 00:03:46.680 After I helped him improve and --> 00:03:48.960 enlarge the movement in the shoulder joints, --> 00:03:50.240 we did another test. --> 00:03:53.439 Now he has only about half of the --> 00:03:56.240 lateral forces compared to the first test, --> 00:03:58.280 and the only thing we changed --> 00:04:00.599 was the movement in the shoulders. --> 00:04:06.919 So that's why this movement is so super important. --> 00:04:10.159 You might think that, oh, it's logical. --> 00:04:14.240 The hands should move back and forth like --> 00:04:17.399 this because you want all the kinetic energy --> 00:04:21.839 going in the direction of travel. Because I am going --> 00:04:24.680 forward, so I want the energy going forward. --> 00:04:28.399 And that's a good idea, but if --> 00:04:32.759 your hand moves in front of your body, --> 00:04:37.279 the foot on the opposite side will also move forward. --> 00:04:42.000 So if you start to run like this with --> 00:04:45.000 your hands moving in front of the body, --> 00:04:49.240 you can be quite sure that you will start to over stride. --> 00:04:50.680 And we don't want that. --> 00:04:52.279 And let's get back to another --> 00:04:54.399 thing about the cadence and the arms. --> 00:04:55.920 Physics works like this. --> 00:05:00.519 If you have a long pendulum, it will swing slowly, --> 00:05:03.079 and the short pendulum will swing --> 00:05:05.519 faster because that's how it works. --> 00:05:07.399 And same thing with arms. --> 00:05:13.040 If you have your hands down here, the arms will move slower --> 00:05:17.720 compared to when you have a shorter pendulum in your arms. --> 00:05:21.639 So you want to have quite a sharp angle in your elbow, --> 00:05:25.439 not the 90 degrees that is often suggested. --> 00:05:27.399 And if you look at elite runners, --> 00:05:30.720 they rarely have the 90 degrees in the --> 00:05:34.519 elbow. It's a much sharper angle, more like this. --> 00:05:44.399 And you also want to have your --> 00:05:47.240 central mass quite high in the body. --> 00:05:49.720 How do you get a higher central mass? --> 00:05:53.600 Well, if you move your hands up, up, --> 00:05:57.240 up like this to about heart height, --> 00:06:00.879 the height of your heart, your central mass --> 00:06:03.839 will be higher than if you take your hands --> 00:06:06.600 down here. And it's so easy to try. --> 00:06:11.000 If you think about it, hold your hands here and get a nice --> 00:06:13.879 swing, compact swing like this. --> 00:06:16.600 I know it feels so ridiculous in --> 00:06:17.879 the beginning the first time you try. --> 00:06:20.680 It's like you're a Tyrannosaurus. --> 00:06:28.279 But if you swing the arms here and then just take down the --> 00:06:30.399 hands a little bit like this, --> 00:06:32.560 you can feel the difference. --> 00:06:37.879 And now my hands also start to swing in front of the body, --> 00:06:40.279 which makes the wrist very big --> 00:06:42.199 for the opposite foot to move --> 00:06:44.279 forward, creating an over stride. --> 00:06:50.240 So the arms close to the body, a relaxed swing and movement --> 00:06:53.399 in the shoulder going up, up, up. --> 00:06:55.120 Sometimes I force people to run --> 00:06:56.959 with their index fingers like this, --> 00:07:00.800 just to make sure that they can feel it's up, up, up. --> 00:07:02.519 It looks ridiculous, so they --> 00:07:03.639 can't do it out on the streets. --> 00:07:07.560 But when they train, yes, this could be a good idea. --> 00:07:11.079 Are the index finger moving up? Yes, they are. --> 00:07:13.800 It's not like this. --> 00:07:16.839 Just look at Eliud Kipchoge for instance. --> 00:07:18.519 When this is recorded, he's the only --> 00:07:22.240 person that has run a marathon under two hours. --> 00:07:26.279 His hands rarely leave his shirt. --> 00:07:31.399 It's very, very, very close like this. --> 00:07:37.240 So watch now what happens when I have my hands here, 90 --> 00:07:39.680 degrees in the elbows, or here. --> 00:07:41.759 If you can see if there are any differences. --> 00:07:45.199 I will now run at the pace of about five minutes per --> 00:07:48.600 kilometer, that's about eight minutes per mile. --> 00:07:52.240 Arms close to the body. --> 00:07:59.720 My upper arm becomes vertical, elbow swings forward, --> 00:08:05.319 hand, hands about the height on my heart. --> 00:08:09.680 And now I take the hands down a bit. --> 00:08:15.839 And up, up, up, up, up. --> 00:08:18.360 Up, up, up, up, up. --> 00:08:21.120 And down. --> 00:08:26.439 And now my legs feel really heavy. --> 00:08:29.959 I bring the arms up again. --> 00:08:34.799 And you see where I land right now? --> 00:08:42.960 What happens if I start to move my hands forward like this? --> 00:08:52.080 And I bring them back in again."

Fredrik will answer these questions and debunk common myths about running technique. --> 00:00:11.080 Some people are exceptionally good to run with a really --> 00:00:14.279 straight knee and landing quite far in front of them. --> 00:00:15.960 And you could say that, \"Oh, this is --> 00:00:17.800 bad because you land on your heel.\" --> 00:00:21.879 No, this is not bad because I land on my heel. --> 00:00:24.000 It's bad because the foot is in front --> 00:00:26.559 of my hip, in front of my center of mass. --> 00:00:29.839 It would be equally bad if I did --> 00:00:32.880 like this and put the forefoot down. --> 00:00:34.640 Forefoot landing doesn't have --> 00:00:37.039 to be better than heel landing. --> 00:00:41.039 It all depends on where the foot lands in relation to the --> 00:00:44.640 other body parts and the way down onto the ground. --> 00:00:48.840 If the foot has a movement going forward, you will --> 00:00:51.000 increase the risk of braking forces, of course. --> 00:00:55.759 So the foot should more move like the knee coming up and --> 00:00:59.719 you get a more vertical way of the --> 00:01:01.759 foot moving down towards the ground. --> 00:01:03.759 It doesn't matter if you land on --> 00:01:06.200 your heel, midfoot or forefoot. --> 00:01:09.480 It is the landing in front of you that is bad. --> 00:01:11.480 Some people have heard that they --> 00:01:13.239 should land more on their forefoot. --> 00:01:17.560 But what they do then is just having their foot here and --> 00:01:20.079 then, \"Oh, I should land more on my forefoot.\" --> 00:01:22.000 And do like this. --> 00:01:26.079 And this is even further away in front of my body. --> 00:01:28.640 Over striding can increase the risk of injury. --> 00:01:32.200 It also makes your contact time much longer. --> 00:01:36.159 You want to have the foot much shorter time on the ground. --> 00:01:37.719 The shorter time, the better. --> 00:01:41.760 And landing in front of you, it will take some time before --> 00:01:43.840 the foot has moved here and is --> 00:01:46.840 lifted instead of landing here to here. --> 00:01:50.760 Much shorter, shorter contact time, better efficiency. --> 00:01:54.840 But the most common thing with over striding is that you put --> 00:01:57.000 your heel too much in front of you. --> 00:02:00.799 If we now move the foot closer under your central mass, --> 00:02:04.920 here you can see, \"Oh, this is more midfoot. --> 00:02:06.840 And this is more heel strike.\" --> 00:02:11.759 So it's the better placement of the foot in relation to --> 00:02:13.759 your body, your hip, your central mass. --> 00:02:16.840 That makes you run more on your midfoot. --> 00:02:18.520 And that's important because you --> 00:02:21.000 can't say, \"Oh, midfoot is good here. --> 00:02:23.759 Then it's good also over here.\" --> 00:02:25.080 Because it's not. --> 00:02:28.639 Now I have an overstride and I land on my heel. --> 00:02:35.520 Now I also have an overstride but land on my forefoot. --> 00:02:40.240 This is just as bad as the overstride on the heel. --> 00:02:42.800 It just gives slightly different injuries. --> 00:02:47.240 So remember, it is not so important which part of the foot --> 00:02:49.199 or shoe that goes down first. --> 00:02:53.599 The important thing is where it goes down in relation to --> 00:02:56.599 all the other body parts and your central mass."

Join Fredrik as he addresses these questions and explains why lifting your chest might not be the best idea for optimal running performance. --> 00:00:10.560 In the running community, there's a lot of talk about --> 00:00:13.439 having a good posture when you run. --> 00:00:16.760 And of course, it's good to have a good posture, but --> 00:00:19.839 there's a problem with the thing about good --> 00:00:23.920 posture. It is that a lot of people try to have this good --> 00:00:27.519 posture by lifting their chest like this. --> 00:00:33.399 \"Mmm, I have a good posture, a good posture.\" But that's --> 00:00:36.119 not so good at all, because first of all, --> 00:00:39.960 it's not relaxed. You have to have a static tension in your --> 00:00:42.960 body if you are trying to have the chest --> 00:00:46.520 lifted all the time you run. And static tensions in the --> 00:00:50.119 body is always bad. Relaxation is super --> 00:00:53.439 important in all sports. And there's also a lot of things --> 00:00:56.200 happening in the rest of the body when you --> 00:00:59.560 lift your chest. You can try it if you stand up and just --> 00:01:03.079 stand like this. Now I have my chest in some --> 00:01:07.959 kind of neutral position. And if I lift the sternum here --> 00:01:12.000 like this, \"Oh, I have a good posture.\" What --> 00:01:15.239 happens? Well, I start to arch my back. When you arch your --> 00:01:18.519 back, you also tilt your pelvis so it --> 00:01:22.640 ends up in a position that is not that good. If you want to --> 00:01:24.319 optimize the force you can get --> 00:01:27.920 from the glutes, the hip and the core muscles. And another --> 00:01:31.280 thing, if I lift my chest, I also kind of --> 00:01:37.319 lock the shoulders. It's so much harder to have this good --> 00:01:40.560 neutral position arm swing like this. --> 00:01:47.079 If I lift my chest, I start to run like this. And then my --> 00:01:50.560 elbows stay behind my back like this. --> 00:02:19.120 And when I don't have sufficient movement in the shoulder --> 00:02:21.360 joint, I will start to turn the body. --> 00:02:25.879 And then the central mass will start to move laterally. You --> 00:02:27.240 have a lot of lateral forces, --> 00:02:30.599 which is not so good for your running economy. And also --> 00:02:33.400 lifting your chest is not so good for --> 00:02:36.960 your breathing. You can just try it if you stand like this --> 00:02:40.319 and lift your chest. And now you take --> 00:02:47.719 as deep a breath as you can down to your belly. And then --> 00:02:50.759 let the chest go down and take a deep --> 00:02:56.800 breath now. And again, lift your chest and take a deep --> 00:03:01.439 breath. You can probably feel how much more --> 00:03:05.039 shallow your breathing is when you have lifted your chest. --> 00:03:07.680 Some runners have problem with their --> 00:03:10.280 breathing. They can say things \"Oh, it doesn't feel like I --> 00:03:12.840 get the air down in my lungs. --> 00:03:17.080 What should I do?\" And unfortunately, a lot of times they --> 00:03:20.120 get the advice to lift their chest, --> 00:03:25.240 to let the air in. No, you don't get more air in when you --> 00:03:27.159 lift your chest. It is the other way --> 00:03:32.280 around. Well, of course, you shouldn't run like this. Chest --> 00:03:35.479 down. I didn't say that. But a lifted --> 00:03:39.599 chest will lock your shoulders so the shoulder joints can't --> 00:03:41.639 move enough. You will arch your back, --> 00:03:45.319 tilting your pelvis in a bad way and not be good for your --> 00:03:48.280 breathing. So please don't lift your chest. --> 00:03:51.800 But where should the chest be then? Well, if you think --> 00:03:54.280 about it like this, now I stand like this. --> 00:03:58.680 My ribcage follow like my belly down here. It's a straight --> 00:04:02.719 line here. If I lift my chest, --> 00:04:08.400 you can feel that the ribcage goes forward. We don't want --> 00:04:11.719 that. And now I let it down. But I don't --> 00:04:17.279 want it to be here either, because now my ribcage goes in --> 00:04:20.560 compared to my belly. So this more or less --> 00:04:23.399 straight line, neutral relaxed --> 00:04:26.759 position is the best for running. --> 00:04:35.000 Normal relaxed neutral chest. And I lift my chest. --> 00:04:41.279 The elbow stays too far behind me. I arch my back, become a --> 00:04:44.839 little bit seated, letting the chest come down. --> 00:04:49.120 There you go. And lifting the chest again. --> 00:04:58.120 But as I say, even if you shouldn't lift your chest, maybe --> 00:04:59.680 you shouldn't run like this either."

In this video, Fredrik will discuss the importance of hip positioning in running. Why is it crucial to avoid overstriding and maintain proper hip alignment? What are the benefits of having your hips aligned over your feet? Join Fredrik as he answers these questions and provides practical tips for optimizing your hip position for better running efficiency. --> 00:00:10.880 One of the more common instructions from running coaches is --> 00:00:13.240 that you should move your hip forward. --> 00:00:15.039 It's not always completely --> 00:00:17.280 clear on what they actually mean. --> 00:00:20.320 If I run like this, should the hip should move forward? --> 00:00:22.239 Should it be like this? --> 00:00:23.760 Should I run like this? --> 00:00:28.519 And some coaches say, well, the hip should be up, up, --> 00:00:30.239 and forward. --> 00:00:32.880 It's really hard to understand what they mean. --> 00:00:36.640 For many recreational runners, it is the part of the body --> 00:00:39.799 that is below where you have your chest --> 00:00:43.359 strap for your heart rate monitor, which is around here. --> 00:00:48.359 This part is normally quite good. --> 00:00:54.439 It is this part that is moved back too much like this. --> 00:00:57.560 And the problem now is that when people --> 00:01:00.359 say, oh, now you're leaning too much forward, --> 00:01:02.880 most runners do like this. --> 00:01:04.599 Okay, I lean too much. --> 00:01:06.000 I should not lean. --> 00:01:09.400 I should straighten up my body so I do this. --> 00:01:11.879 Oh, this feels hard. --> 00:01:12.680 Nope. --> 00:01:17.400 It is only the part below your heart rate monitor. --> 00:01:20.439 This part should be moved here. --> 00:01:24.480 Now I have a more straight body. --> 00:01:29.760 You want to stack all the body parts up on the feet. --> 00:01:33.560 Everything should be stacked on top of your feet. --> 00:01:35.480 There is a lot of bad things going --> 00:01:38.560 on when you have your hip like this --> 00:01:41.159 and you run a little bit seated like this. --> 00:01:46.280 One thing is that this part now gets quite soft like this, --> 00:01:52.200 which will give you a longer contact time. --> 00:01:54.840 If you run on a sandy beach, it will be --> 00:01:57.200 quite hard because the sand is very soft. --> 00:02:00.400 You won't get any elastic recoil because --> 00:02:03.760 you don't bounce off the ground like you do --> 00:02:04.719 when you run on a road. --> 00:02:09.439 In the soft sand, you just sink down, no elastic recoil, --> 00:02:13.080 no energy returned from the rubber band system in the body. --> 00:02:14.639 The Stretch Shortening Cycle. --> 00:02:19.439 But some people have their sandy beach inside their bodies. --> 00:02:22.439 So when they land, they are quite soft. --> 00:02:30.159 And then they will also have a very long contact time. --> 00:02:34.240 And when they run with their hips here, seated like this, --> 00:02:37.800 it gets very soft here for most runners. --> 00:02:41.039 So therefore, we want to put this part, --> 00:02:44.080 everything below the heart rate monitor, --> 00:02:46.240 to here. --> 00:02:50.319 You're not supposed to push hard. --> 00:02:51.879 A lot of people do that and they --> 00:02:55.000 feel pain here in the lower back. --> 00:02:57.240 They say, \"I'm pushing so hard on here.\" --> 00:03:00.039 Yes, but you're supposed to just do like this. --> 00:03:02.319 Completely relaxed. --> 00:03:04.520 There are not supposed to be any --> 00:03:08.479 tensions in your core whatsoever when you run. --> 00:03:12.000 You can't have a static tension in your core muscles. --> 00:03:14.199 And you know that there is a big --> 00:03:16.400 difference between how you look --> 00:03:19.719 when you're sitting at home in your sofa on Friday night. --> 00:03:21.840 You have the sofa belly like this. --> 00:03:26.120 Yes, this is the relaxed sofa belly. --> 00:03:28.439 And then you have the beach belly. --> 00:03:30.360 This is the beach belly. --> 00:03:33.080 Yes, when you run, it is the sofa --> 00:03:34.919 belly that you are supposed to have. --> 00:03:36.719 Completely relaxed. --> 00:03:40.240 Relaxation is super important in all sports. --> 00:03:41.639 And of course, even running. --> 00:03:43.439 So it's more like you take your --> 00:03:46.719 big sofa belly and put it here. --> 00:03:48.479 Relax here. --> 00:03:50.120 Much better. --> 00:03:55.039 And it is the part below your heart rate monitor only. --> 00:03:58.000 Not for all runners, of course, because --> 00:03:59.919 some runners are very vertical and some --> 00:04:01.520 even lead a little bit back, --> 00:04:02.879 then you can't move the hip forward. --> 00:04:05.759 But for a majority of recreational runners, --> 00:04:08.599 they run too much seated like this. --> 00:04:09.840 And it looks like this. --> 00:04:17.959 This part is quite good. --> 00:04:21.040 But not this part. --> 00:04:26.800 And then I take my sofa belly and just lift it up here. --> 00:04:28.120 Here. --> 00:04:31.040 Oh, much better. --> 00:04:34.319 And lift it down again. --> 00:04:38.839 And lift it up. --> 00:04:42.600 And lift it down. --> 00:04:45.399 When I run like that, you can also see what --> 00:04:48.839 happens with my landing and my over stride. --> 00:04:50.600 Because as I said, you shouldn't --> 00:04:52.720 land too much in front of your body, --> 00:04:55.240 but it's quite hard to bring the --> 00:04:58.839 foot under your body like this. --> 00:05:02.040 When moving your belly, your hip forward, --> 00:05:07.120 it's more about moving the hip on top of your feet. --> 00:05:10.000 Instead of thinking, oh, I shouldn't always try it. --> 00:05:12.120 I should put my feet under my body. --> 00:05:13.319 No, no, no. --> 00:05:16.680 We get the body on top of the feet. --> 00:05:18.199 Watch one more time. --> 00:05:26.079 Right now, I land quite good under my central mass, --> 00:05:30.120 but my feet are in front of my hip. --> 00:05:38.399 And now I just lift the hip, the belly, up on my feet. --> 00:05:40.240 Oh, and look now. --> 00:05:43.079 The feet are more under my hip. --> 00:05:47.720 Or is it the hip that is more on top of my feet? --> 00:05:50.839 And then I lift the hip back again. --> 00:05:53.399 And now the hip. --> 00:05:57.360 And now the hip is behind the feet. --> 00:05:59.759 Or if it's my feet that is in --> 00:06:01.519 front of my hip, I'm not really sure, --> 00:06:03.920 but then I lift my hip up again. --> 00:06:06.519 Here. --> 00:06:09.160 And no more over stride. --> 00:06:12.560 Because even though I didn't have --> 00:06:15.120 any over stride, when the hip was back, --> 00:06:18.040 there's a great risk that I --> 00:06:20.360 still have a lot of breaking forces. --> 00:06:23.480 But when I get my hip on top of my --> 00:06:26.160 feet, the belly, the relaxed sofa belly, --> 00:06:29.560 on top of my feet, the breaking --> 00:06:31.680 forces will probably disappear. --> 00:06:34.120 Or at least decrease quite a lot. --> 00:06:37.519 So make sure, run like a cross-country skier. --> 00:06:40.600 Get your body up on your ski pole. --> 00:06:42.959 The ski pole is leaning backwards. --> 00:06:44.399 Here. --> 00:06:47.120 Oh, much better."

How can you ensure your athletes maintain the correct posture? Fredrik will answer these questions and provide practical tips for optimizing your lean to improve your running form and efficiency. --> 00:00:09.839 Most runners know that you are --> 00:00:12.560 supposed to lean a little bit forward. --> 00:00:15.359 But what most runners don't know is --> 00:00:18.800 how small this leaning is supposed to be. --> 00:00:20.960 For normal recreational runners, the --> 00:00:24.640 average runner, it is about 3 degrees. --> 00:00:28.199 Maybe 4, but probably 3, 3.5 degrees. --> 00:00:32.039 If we measure the point from the hip to the shoulder. --> 00:00:34.079 And that is not much. --> 00:00:37.759 If you imagine a clock, you know, a round one, not a --> 00:00:40.359 digital one, with hands showing the time. --> 00:00:42.920 There are 60 seconds. --> 00:00:46.640 Imagine now that there are 360 --> 00:00:51.679 seconds in one circle on the watch face. --> 00:00:57.039 360 little lines crammed in this watch. --> 00:01:01.039 And then you are supposed to lean 3 --> 00:01:06.120 of those 360 seconds around the clock. --> 00:01:07.680 It's almost nothing. --> 00:01:11.519 It's from here to here. --> 00:01:19.239 And that's it. --> 00:01:22.519 Most people that come to me lean too much. --> 00:01:26.920 Which immediately increases the risk of braking forces and --> 00:01:29.480 also increases the contact time. --> 00:01:33.640 And more contact time, less energy return from the rubber --> 00:01:35.480 band system, the Stretch Shortening Cycle, --> 00:01:37.159 and making you less efficient. --> 00:01:39.680 So the big problem with most runners --> 00:01:42.280 is not that they don't lean enough. --> 00:01:44.719 It is that they lean too much. --> 00:01:46.799 But there are of course exceptions. --> 00:01:51.079 Some runners are too vertical in their --> 00:01:54.280 body or even lean slightly backwards. --> 00:01:57.599 And what happens is when they get too vertical or lean --> 00:02:00.120 back, that when this part of the body --> 00:02:03.280 moves that way, the feet will probably --> 00:02:06.680 move in the other direction to keep balance. --> 00:02:11.599 So the leaning slight back will probably make them --> 00:02:14.719 over stride because the foot moves forward. --> 00:02:18.879 And then making them more vertical or even leanings, you --> 00:02:20.680 can probably get the foot a --> 00:02:23.960 little bit more under their body. --> 00:02:27.159 But it's such a small adjustment forward. --> 00:02:28.360 I can show you. --> 00:02:30.439 First I'm going to try to run and --> 00:02:33.400 be as vertical as I can in my body. --> 00:02:34.759 And it looks like this. --> 00:02:39.000 Now I'm quite vertical I hope. --> 00:02:42.599 And how much leaning should I do? --> 00:02:47.240 Well it's from here to here. --> 00:02:49.680 This is a good leaning. --> 00:02:52.240 Too vertical. --> 00:02:55.599 Good leaning. --> 00:02:58.039 What happens if I lean more? --> 00:03:00.599 No, not good, not good. --> 00:03:02.400 Vertical. --> 00:03:05.080 Good leaning. --> 00:03:07.879 Vertical. --> 00:03:10.039 Leaning back. --> 00:03:11.159 And watch my feet. --> 00:03:14.759 When I start to lean back, the feet move forward. --> 00:03:16.520 Vertical. --> 00:03:18.240 Leaning forward. --> 00:03:20.520 What happens to the feet? --> 00:03:22.680 Going too straight. --> 00:03:27.039 And now leaning back, feet move forward. --> 00:03:28.879 Vertical. --> 00:03:30.960 Leaning back. --> 00:03:33.800 Vertical. --> 00:03:35.960 Slightly forward. --> 00:03:42.520 The problem with the runners who are leaning back a bit is --> 00:03:43.719 that when you tell them \"well, --> 00:03:47.120 lean more forward\" it's very hard for them to do. --> 00:03:52.240 For them it can be better if you instead of saying \"this --> 00:03:54.599 part should lean more forward\" --> 00:03:59.439 that you move the bottom half back. --> 00:04:01.080 It is the same thing. --> 00:04:05.680 Now I'm leaning or pushing this part backwards. --> 00:04:08.960 As long as I have a straight body, this is --> 00:04:11.759 also leaning but I moved the bottom part. --> 00:04:15.120 If you imagine that I am on a bicycle. --> 00:04:20.839 Now I have my pedals below my body. --> 00:04:25.160 And now my pedals are a bit in front of me. --> 00:04:30.680 And now my pedals are a little bit more behind me. --> 00:04:35.839 And just to be clear, the foot does not move in a circle. --> 00:04:37.519 Not at all. --> 00:04:38.839 I know there's a lot of coaches saying --> 00:04:41.120 \"well, the feet should move like a wheel, --> 00:04:44.839 like in a circle, like it moves like here and there and --> 00:04:46.759 going back, oh it is a circle\". --> 00:04:48.040 No it's not. --> 00:04:49.120 It looks like this. --> 00:04:52.759 And this is from the software I use to analyze an energy --> 00:04:54.879 efficiency of the runners that come to me. --> 00:04:59.319 And this is actually the picture of elite runners. --> 00:05:02.879 A couple of Swedish elite runners, they are about 10 to 15 --> 00:05:05.680 people that have been merged into one --> 00:05:09.240 Person and then their feet look like this. --> 00:05:12.000 It's not a circle at all. --> 00:05:13.680 Maybe it's an eggplant. --> 00:05:18.160 Anyway, the two vertical people or leaning back people may --> 00:05:21.120 benefit not from the instruction --> 00:05:25.120 \"lean forward\" but moving the pedals slightly back. --> 00:05:27.240 Just a tiny, tiny bit. --> 00:05:28.600 Like this. --> 00:05:32.360 Now my pedals are kind of --> 00:05:35.000 under me, under my body, my pedals. --> 00:05:38.759 And now I move the pedals a little bit forward. --> 00:05:41.199 And then I start to lean back. --> 00:05:45.519 And then I bring the pedals under me. --> 00:05:49.319 And a little bit back. --> 00:05:52.120 And then I start to lean. --> 00:05:56.319 And move them under me again. --> 00:05:59.000 And slightly back again. --> 00:06:05.199 And if it becomes too much, so around like this, I just --> 00:06:08.399 take my sofa belly and put it up here. --> 00:06:09.560 There. --> 00:06:12.680 And then you have the --> 00:06:16.079 combination from bringing the belly down, --> 00:06:17.600 pedals under me, --> 00:06:19.480 pedals back, --> 00:06:23.360 and belly, hip here."

Why is maintaining a forward-facing head position essential for proper running form? What causes many runners to struggle with keeping their head in the correct position, often looking down or up unknowingly? How do elite runners benefit from consistently facing forward towards the horizon, and in what ways does this simple tip improve running form? How can focusing on head position enhance upper body movement, landing, and overall running efficiency? Why does avoiding excessive weight shifts by keeping the head forward help recreational runners move with greater ease and control? Fredrik will answer these questions in the following video and share practical tips on the topic. --> 00:00:09.720 As I said so many times now, balance --> 00:00:12.359 is a big part of your running technique. --> 00:00:16.280 If body weight is moved in one direction, the body will --> 00:00:18.120 move another part in the other --> 00:00:22.239 direction to try to be in balance. So now we look at the --> 00:00:25.960 head. The face is supposed to be forward. --> 00:00:30.640 Face towards the horizon. I know that I have looked down a --> 00:00:33.039 bit doing these instruction videos now --> 00:00:35.039 because when you run on treadmill I don't --> 00:00:36.719 want to fall off. It's hard to have your --> 00:00:39.560 eyes over here all the time. But outside - --> 00:00:47.840 always forward. Because what happens if my head falls a --> 00:00:49.240 little bit forward like this? --> 00:00:54.399 Because I start looking down, weight is moved this way, --> 00:00:56.799 then the body will move weight in the --> 00:00:58.240 other direction and it will --> 00:01:04.040 probably be the hip. Face there. Hip here. --> 00:01:08.959 The problem now is that a lot of runners --> 00:01:11.879 don't know where they have their head and --> 00:01:15.840 what are they looking at at all. Some people run like this, --> 00:01:18.239 but they still have their eyes --> 00:01:19.799 forward and say \"well I'm looking --> 00:01:22.280 forward\". No you're not because your head is down. --> 00:01:26.760 And some people run like this and they end up in this --> 00:01:29.760 position. \"Oh my head is forward totally\". --> 00:01:36.079 No, your face is facing up. No, I can feel it. I see you --> 00:01:38.439 straight forward. This is forward. --> 00:01:41.200 And then you just film them and show them \"no you're not\". --> 00:01:43.840 But in a nice way. Always be nice. --> 00:01:47.319 But always know that they don't have a clue what they look --> 00:01:49.680 like. So face towards the horizon. --> 00:01:53.480 And it's quite easy just to run and look down a bit, --> 00:01:58.200 forward and up and see what happens. --> 00:02:02.280 You can probably feel that a lot of things are happening in --> 00:02:04.560 your upper body and even how you --> 00:02:08.680 land and where you land in relation to your central mass. --> 00:02:10.960 Not all people, but a lot of people --> 00:02:15.680 can notice quite a lot. And if you notice recreational --> 00:02:17.919 runners out running, most of them --> 00:02:22.159 run like this and then they drop their hands and everything --> 00:02:25.439 gets heavy this way and then they sit --> 00:02:29.039 down. And then you tell them \"move the hip forward\". But --> 00:02:31.719 they can't. Why? Because they have so much --> 00:02:35.599 weight going this way. I rarely say where you should have --> 00:02:39.159 your eyes. Look forward. Could be good. --> 00:02:44.599 But as I said, I'm looking forward right now and right now. --> 00:02:47.759 But I'm not interested in where your --> 00:02:52.879 eyes are. I'm interested in the head. It's supposed to be --> 00:02:54.080 here. And look at elite runners. --> 00:02:58.680 Face forward, face towards the horizon. All the time."

perception and reality. --> 00:00:09.519 Maybe you heard that the leaning --> 00:00:12.080 of the body also controls the pace. --> 00:00:15.080 The more you lean, the faster you run. --> 00:00:17.440 But that is not true at all. --> 00:00:21.519 Leaning a lot forward is good during acceleration. --> 00:00:27.120 Because if the leaning should control the pace and that the --> 00:00:29.160 faster you run, the more you lean, --> 00:00:31.800 then the best sprinters in the world, --> 00:00:33.799 like Usain Bolt, who has the world record --> 00:00:36.799 when I record this at least, he doesn't --> 00:00:40.240 lean at all when he has his top speed. --> 00:00:43.920 At top speed, he is vertical in his body. --> 00:00:47.640 Not during acceleration, but at top speed. --> 00:00:50.240 But as an HYROX athlete, your --> 00:00:53.359 acceleration phase is about this much. --> 00:00:58.240 So yes, you can lean a bit extra forward this much and then --> 00:01:01.039 keep the body at about 3 degrees --> 00:01:02.840 of your leaning and face forward. --> 00:01:04.920 But isn't the leaning also supposed --> 00:01:07.640 to make you kind of lose your balance? --> 00:01:09.560 Well, no. --> 00:01:15.439 But also, yes, it is good if you have a slight feeling of --> 00:01:17.120 losing your balance when you run. --> 00:01:20.879 That is true, but that doesn't come from your leaning. --> 00:01:22.599 It comes from where your center of --> 00:01:25.239 mass is in relation to your feet. --> 00:01:27.799 And that is the feet that is on the ground. --> 00:01:34.319 Because if I stand like this, my body is quite vertical. --> 00:01:37.879 But I have lost my balance, or at least --> 00:01:40.920 I would lose it if I lifted this hand. --> 00:01:44.120 But the body is vertical. --> 00:01:47.079 This is what I look like when I run like this. --> 00:01:48.040 Kind of vertical. --> 00:01:53.239 And now I'm leaning, but I haven't lost my balance. --> 00:01:57.920 And now the body is vertical, but I have lost my balance. --> 00:02:00.400 So it's not the leaning that gets --> 00:02:02.879 runners slightly out of balance. --> 00:02:06.359 It's more the thing we did when moving the --> 00:02:08.919 hip, the belly a little bit more forward. --> 00:02:09.960 Like this. --> 00:02:14.520 Now my center of mass is in front of the --> 00:02:16.759 place where I have the foot on the ground. --> 00:02:20.280 Therefore I have lost my balance a little bit. --> 00:02:22.599 And we can also use this to help --> 00:02:25.520 runners and athletes to get the feeling of --> 00:02:27.960 slightly losing their balance so that --> 00:02:30.599 they don't run so much that they just --> 00:02:34.639 go with the flow when they lose their balance. --> 00:02:38.319 A very good trick is to do this with another person. --> 00:02:40.520 What you do is that one person stands --> 00:02:43.439 behind the other and puts his or her hands --> 00:02:45.960 on the hip like this. --> 00:02:48.240 This is the hands of the person behind me. --> 00:02:53.280 And then I fall forward a little bit and then move the hip, --> 00:02:55.960 the part below the heart rate monitor, --> 00:02:57.599 to here. --> 00:03:01.520 And now someone is holding my hip. --> 00:03:02.639 I'm going to show you in a minute, --> 00:03:04.240 but right now there's no one behind me --> 00:03:06.039 and I have to hold on here. --> 00:03:10.759 Now I am out of balance and in this position start to run. --> 00:03:14.080 Lifting my feet straight up like this. --> 00:03:21.879 And if I let go of that hand, I will start to run. --> 00:03:26.080 And if you do it with another person, it looks like this. --> 00:03:30.520 The person behind puts their hands on the runner's hips. --> 00:03:33.039 Then the runner goes up on tiptoe and --> 00:03:35.159 moves the hip forward a little in the same way, --> 00:03:37.879 as I said earlier, when lifting the part of --> 00:03:39.879 the body that is under the chest strap for --> 00:03:40.680 the heart rate monitor. --> 00:03:44.039 I have my relaxed sofa belly on top of my --> 00:03:45.960 feet, which means I have lost my balance --> 00:03:48.560 and would fall forward or run away --> 00:03:51.080 if it wasn't for her holding my hip. --> 00:03:55.080 There is a pressure against her hands, but not that much. --> 00:03:58.800 Many people think that it is the leaning that makes you get --> 00:04:00.199 the feeling of losing your balance --> 00:04:03.400 a bit, which means that they lean too much forward, which --> 00:04:04.800 means that they lean much more --> 00:04:05.639 forward than this. --> 00:04:08.000 But as I wrote here, my body is --> 00:04:09.960 only leaning about three degrees. --> 00:04:11.919 Can feel almost vertical. --> 00:04:13.719 So now I'm out of balance. --> 00:04:16.319 And at this point, I start running on the spot. --> 00:04:18.839 I lift my feet straight up. --> 00:04:20.839 When the person behind me lets --> 00:04:22.839 go of my hips, I start running. --> 00:04:25.319 I don't try to start running forwards. --> 00:04:28.959 The only thing I do is lift my feet and move my central --> 00:04:30.720 mass forward by moving my hips --> 00:04:32.560 and my stomach up and forward. --> 00:04:34.680 So I end up out of balance. --> 00:04:38.120 Then it's not much harder than running on the spot. --> 00:04:41.240 It is a bit like jumping up and down on a pogo stick. --> 00:04:44.480 And if your central mass moves in one direction, you will --> 00:04:46.680 start moving in that direction on --> 00:04:47.680 your pogo stick. --> 00:04:51.439 So running is like bouncing up and down on a pogo stick --> 00:04:53.759 while being slightly out of balance. --> 00:04:55.959 One of the common mistakes runners make --> 00:04:58.680 when holding them by the hip is that they lean --> 00:05:02.680 too much forward, which of course is not good at all. --> 00:05:07.519 You can see how much she struggles to hold on. --> 00:05:10.399 There should be some pressure on the hands of the person --> 00:05:12.240 holding, but not that much at all. --> 00:05:15.399 Some runners don't like to be off balance and have too --> 00:05:17.360 little pressure on their hands. --> 00:05:20.720 So when you let go, they keep running on the spot. --> 00:05:23.560 If they don't start running because they are too vertical, --> 00:05:25.399 you can ask them to lean forward --> 00:05:26.439 a little bit more. --> 00:05:29.399 And if they don't lose their balance, you can ask them to --> 00:05:31.399 lift their hips or their belly up --> 00:05:32.519 forward a little more. --> 00:05:36.319 The problem is that some people are so reluctant to be out --> 00:05:37.879 of balance that they move their --> 00:05:41.879 hip and lean forward as you say, but there is no pressure --> 00:05:44.240 on the hands, which means that --> 00:05:45.800 they do not lose their balance and --> 00:05:47.639 start running forward when you let go. --> 00:05:50.120 And then there are those who start lifting their feet --> 00:05:52.120 backwards when running on the spot. --> 00:05:54.199 But they too will not start --> 00:05:56.040 running when you let go of the hip. --> 00:05:58.959 I usually ask them to focus on being a little bit more --> 00:06:00.839 vertical in their body and to think --> 00:06:03.879 that their knees should be lifted more up forward. --> 00:06:05.759 Then it usually gets better. --> 00:06:08.519 The idea is that it should feel like --> 00:06:10.920 you're always running slightly downhill. --> 00:06:15.639 And not too brag, but for me it actually always feels like --> 00:06:17.560 I'm running slightly downhill, --> 00:06:19.959 even when it's slightly uphill. --> 00:06:23.120 Once you have been helped to find the feeling of just --> 00:06:24.759 lifting your feet and losing your --> 00:06:26.240 balance a bit by moving your --> 00:06:28.079 central mass, you can do it yourself. --> 00:06:31.800 Just run on the spot, fall a little forward and then lift --> 00:06:33.839 up forward the hip, the stomach, --> 00:06:36.199 so the central mass is further forward. --> 00:06:40.519 --> 00:06:44.800 It is not the leaning that makes me out of balance, it's --> 00:06:46.680 the shift in the center of mass. --> 00:06:49.439 I lift my feet and shift the center of --> 00:06:51.240 mass so I get slightly out of balance, --> 00:06:52.839 which makes me start running. --> 00:06:55.560 Of course, you can always do this on a --> 00:06:58.079 treadmill, although it is more difficult. --> 00:07:01.639 It's harder on the treadmill. --> 00:07:11.759 But when I pick up the pace, yes, it didn't work. --> 00:07:17.160 But let's pick up the pace a bit. --> 00:07:31.079 per kilometer, easy."

Running comes naturally, and if you just run a lot, your body will find a way to run that suits you best. Therefore, learning about running technique is unnecessary.\" These statements you hear lot when you speak with athletes or coaches. While it's true that running comes naturally, there is a significant difference between running to get through daily activities and excelling at it. Just like specialized techniques in high jump or free diving, running efficiently can help you perform better and reduce the risk of injury. In HYROX, where running follows exhausting exercises, conserving energy is crucial. Efficient running means more energy for other tasks like burpees and lunges. Hence, refining every detail of your running technique can make you a better, injury-free HYROX athlete. In the following chapter, you'll learn from Fredrik Zillén, a renowned running technique specialist from Sweden who has transformed the running techniques of thousands, ranging from novice runners to elite athletes, including members of the Swedish national team in running and triathlon. Since 2014, he has analyzed approximately 10,000 runners' energy efficiency using 3D cameras and specialized software. This technology provides precise insights into how adjustments in movement patterns can enhance efficiency and reduce injury risk. But let him speak for himself and his views of running technique and coaching the central part of HYROX: The running. --> 00:00:09.400 Hello and welcome to the part --> 00:00:11.320 about efficient running technique. --> 00:00:14.439 My name is Fredrik Zillen and I work as a running technique --> 00:00:16.800 specialist and have over the years helped --> 00:00:20.399 thousands of runners to a more efficient running technique. --> 00:00:23.719 From the slowest beginners to members of the Swedish --> 00:00:25.960 national team who have set national --> 00:00:28.199 records and participated in the --> 00:00:30.920 Olympics and run world championship finals. --> 00:00:35.039 I have of course also competed in HYROX and even if I --> 00:00:37.600 see myself as a coach and not an athlete --> 00:00:41.280 I have been fortunate enough to qualify for the World --> 00:00:44.119 Championships twice in two attempts. --> 00:00:50.280 The best part of my job is that I don't have to guess. --> 00:00:56.079 Since 2014 I have used 3D cameras and especially developed --> 00:00:59.039 software where I can measure exactly --> 00:01:03.000 how runners move, how much energy they cost, how they load --> 00:01:05.079 their joints and a lot of other things. --> 00:01:10.439 And I have done at least about 10 000 tests over the years --> 00:01:13.239 and I see what small changes in how --> 00:01:16.959 people move can affect all these things. --> 00:01:21.439 Like how shoulder moves can have a great impact on the --> 00:01:25.680 lateral forces in the knees that causes knee pain. And now --> 00:01:28.760 you are going to know how that works too. --> 00:01:31.439 So let's dive into it and we start --> 00:01:35.280 with the basics: how running works. --> 00:01:39.079 Since I am from Sweden, the land of snow and --> 00:01:42.560 ice and Abba, I'm going to compare running --> 00:01:46.400 to a sport that is very very popular in this country, cross --> 00:01:48.719 country skiing. Maybe you haven't --> 00:01:52.000 tried cross country skiing but that doesn't matter but you --> 00:01:54.719 will get this anyway. When you try cross --> 00:01:58.200 country skiing you have ski poles in your hands and if you --> 00:02:00.359 want to go forward in that direction --> 00:02:03.719 it's not very clever to have the ski poles --> 00:02:07.079 pointing in that direction and pushing them --> 00:02:13.400 down, forward down like this. That's not a good idea if you --> 00:02:15.080 want to go that way because that will --> 00:02:19.039 only take you that way of course. So how do you do your --> 00:02:21.159 cross country ski then? Well where do you --> 00:02:26.039 put the poles? Well about where your feet are, which is --> 00:02:29.120 under your center of mass. So the tip of the --> 00:02:32.719 ski pole, the bottom part goes where the feet are. The ski --> 00:02:35.680 poles are leaning slightly this way --> 00:02:39.960 and then you push like this and --> 00:02:41.960 then we'll push the body forward. --> 00:02:48.520 But actually you don't push with your arms, you put your --> 00:02:52.400 body weight up on the ski poles like this. --> 00:02:57.520 And when you put your body weight up on the ski poles you --> 00:03:00.080 don't have to use the muscle force in --> 00:03:03.879 your arms that much. It's mostly just body weight and then --> 00:03:06.719 you push this way. And how can we now --> 00:03:11.039 translate this to running? This translates to running in --> 00:03:13.800 the way that this is your ski pole. --> 00:03:17.439 So remember the cross country skiing putting the ski pole --> 00:03:20.479 in that direction will only create --> 00:03:23.960 braking forces and pushes you backwards and you want to go --> 00:03:26.759 forward of course when you run. So if --> 00:03:33.680 this part is leaning that way you got your ski pole in the --> 00:03:35.960 wrong direction. You're never supposed --> 00:03:44.080 to put your ski pole down like this and have your foot in --> 00:03:47.120 front of your knee. The foot should never --> 00:03:51.599 be in front of the knee ever not anywhere in the gait --> 00:03:54.680 cycle. But if you film recreational runners --> 00:04:00.159 you can see that almost all of them have their foot in --> 00:04:02.840 front of their knee and their ski pole --> 00:04:06.560 in the wrong direction when the foot touches the ground. --> 00:04:11.560 And this is also called over striding. When --> 00:04:15.560 you put your foot down too far in front of your hip in --> 00:04:18.480 front of your center of mass. --> 00:04:22.560 Over striding is never good. So how are we supposed to do instead? --> 00:04:25.519 Well, just like cross-country skiing of --> 00:04:28.879 course. Putting down the ski poles, the tip of the ski --> 00:04:31.879 poles goes down where your feet are below your --> 00:04:36.759 center of mass roughly like this and you don't just push --> 00:04:39.839 with your arms, you put your body weight --> 00:04:45.120 onto the ski pole pushing you this way. Okay so this is the --> 00:04:48.279 ski pole so it's here and then we put --> 00:04:53.959 the body weight up on the foot on the ski pole here and now --> 00:04:56.959 as you can see my ski pole is leaning --> 00:05:02.079 in that direction. So when I put my body weight onto my --> 00:05:06.399 foot I get pushed this way. I have the ski --> 00:05:10.560 pole in the right direction. So check this out I'm going to --> 00:05:13.399 run now and have a look at my lower leg. --> 00:05:15.959 It will be vertical or leaning --> 00:05:18.480 that way first in a slower pace. --> 00:05:27.319 As you can see my foot is never in front of the knee. The --> 00:05:30.079 ski pole my lower leg is vertical --> 00:05:35.839 or leaning that way. I put my body weight up on the --> 00:05:38.800 foot and get pushed that way. --> 00:05:48.839 Instead of what many people do have --> 00:05:55.319 their feet in front of their knees like this --> 00:06:04.439 it's really really hard. Oh I can't do --> 00:06:07.120 it. I'm now going to increase the pace --> 00:06:13.000 still no feet in front of the knee. --> 00:06:16.279 Increase it again --> 00:06:23.759 and still no feet in front of the knee. --> 00:06:28.519 So as you could see there ain't much of --> 00:06:30.720 a difference between running a bit slower --> 00:06:34.560 and a bit faster. The movements are bigger when you run --> 00:06:37.279 faster but they are almost the same --> 00:06:42.399 and you never get the foot in front of the knee. There are --> 00:06:45.319 of course exceptions but this is kind --> 00:06:49.439 of a good rule to have and what is really bad when you do --> 00:06:51.399 this over striding putting your feet --> 00:06:53.839 too much in front of your central mass --> 00:06:57.240 is if you have a completely straight knee. --> 00:07:02.600 When you land if you have a completely straight knee you --> 00:07:05.160 get the forces going up in the knee and --> 00:07:10.639 the hip quite hard. If you have the knee slightly bent the --> 00:07:13.560 knee should always be slightly bent. You --> 00:07:17.560 get a much softer landing here instead of having this --> 00:07:20.879 straight leg. When you see these pictures --> 00:07:24.720 it's easy to think that landing on the heel is obviously --> 00:07:27.120 bad and that you should always aim to --> 00:07:31.360 land more on the forefoot or midfoot but this is not the --> 00:07:34.600 case. Stay tuned for the next video lesson --> 00:07:38.160 to learn how to think about the landing. Should it be on --> 00:07:40.959 the heel, forefoot or midfoot?"

The Sled-Pull demands full-body strength, focusing on the back, legs, and grip as athletes drag the sled backward across the track. It's a unique challenge that tests not only ones physical strength but also the ability to coordinate movements efficiently. Let's hear how Dena and Tom Hogan approach this formidable task. --> 00:00:10.119 Station 3, the sled pull. The key --> 00:00:11.599 to being efficient in the sled pull --> 00:00:15.720 is one, rope management and two, your pull technique. --> 00:00:18.039 The key to the sled pull then is our rope --> 00:00:20.559 management. We want to come up to the box, --> 00:00:23.960 take the tension out of the rope, use our body weight, lean --> 00:00:26.440 back and walk back using the box. --> 00:00:29.960 Here, this is where it's important not to drop the rope --> 00:00:31.519 because now we're inefficient. --> 00:00:33.679 We have to reach back down, take the --> 00:00:35.920 tension and begin the whole process again. --> 00:00:40.600 Instead, we feed the rope through our hands, take the --> 00:00:44.560 tension back, walk and pull the sled. --> 00:00:48.479 Sled pull techniques fall into two --> 00:00:50.799 categories. The first being the arm over arm. --> 00:00:54.719 This technique will be slightly faster but --> 00:00:57.039 as the weights progress from open to pro, --> 00:01:01.600 may be inefficient for most. The second method is to use --> 00:01:03.759 the walk back technique using the full --> 00:01:07.200 one and a half meters of the Hyrox box. The key to --> 00:01:09.120 this is when you pull to the back --> 00:01:11.439 to move to the front forward and don't --> 00:01:13.280 have much dead time in between pulling. --> 00:01:16.840 A really beneficial way to train for the sled pull is to --> 00:01:18.640 isolate the muscle groups that are used. --> 00:01:22.640 Seated position arm over arm like this for the arms and --> 00:01:24.719 back will work. The progression of this --> 00:01:27.840 then is to come up on the knee and then that will engage --> 00:01:29.760 the core, the back and the arms. --> 00:01:32.959 And then finally we can come up to standing, bring it all --> 00:01:34.719 together and work on everything --> 00:01:37.760 including our rope management. Unfortunately, sled pull is --> 00:01:39.680 one of the hardest stations to have --> 00:01:42.760 alternatives for purely because the rope management is so --> 00:01:45.560 important. However, having a strong back --> 00:01:50.120 will help. The alternatives can be bent over rows. --> 00:02:01.519 Another good alternative is pendly rows. --> 00:02:09.479 And you can do these either with a --> 00:02:12.080 barbell or dumbbells. So like sled push, --> 00:02:15.280 sled pull can be quite a daunting station for female --> 00:02:18.960 athletes. It's sometimes hard to remember --> 00:02:22.360 that sled pull times are slower than sled push and it can --> 00:02:24.599 feel like you're moving slow rather --> 00:02:27.639 than remembering it's a slow station. Install some --> 00:02:30.680 confidence in your clients and let them know that --> 00:02:33.639 they have the ability to take the station on. Our tip for --> 00:02:35.919 sled pull and as obvious as it may seem --> 00:02:40.159 is use the chalk. It will only take two to three seconds to --> 00:02:42.000 chalk your hands up but will save you --> 00:02:43.400 a lot of time in the long run. Chapter: Summary Efficiency and Technique: *Rope management: Avoid dropping the rope by feeding it through your hands as you walk backward. *Pull technique: Choose between arm over arm (slightly faster) or walk back (more efficient for heavier weights). *Muscle group isolation: Train seated, on one knee, or standing to target specific muscles. Alternative Exercises: *Bent-over rows: Work your back and arms. *Pendlay rows: Target back muscles. *Use barbell or dumbbells for these exercises. Tips for Female Athletes: *Remember that sled pull is a slower station than sled push. *Build confidence and encourage clients to take on the challenge. *Use chalk to improve grip and prevent slipping. Chapter: The biomechanical perspective As you have to remain in the box while pulling the sled, the natural inclination is to rely predominantly on the upper body to maintain momentum. This often involves leaning back with a slightly offset stance, allowing the rope to be continuously fed behind. However, most athletes may not have the upper body strength required for this approach, and it’s worth noting that this is not necessarily the most efficient technique. A more effective strategy is to engage the entire body to overcome the sled’s inertia. By leaning back against a taut rope and extending the hips, you can initiate the sled's movement. As it starts to move, complete the pull with knee extension and elbow flexion, then reach forward for more rope and repeat. The friction between your shoes and the surface will dictate how far back you can lean, making the choice of footwear an important consideration for optimizing this exercise."

--> 00:01:35.280 Tom grips the sled somewhere between three to four inches --> 00:01:36.599 down from the top of the poles, --> 00:01:40.400 gets his body nice and tight, locks in his lats, --> 00:01:43.560 embraces his core, and then pushes off through the calves. --> 00:01:46.959 Position two, we want to walk into the sled, --> 00:01:49.560 chest goes over the weights. --> 00:01:51.719 What we're doing here by both position --> 00:01:53.319 is always avoiding lift. --> 00:01:56.599 We want to keep the sled base in contact with the ground. --> 00:02:00.319 We want to stand in as close to the waist as possible --> 00:02:03.439 and drive with the glutes all the way through. --> 00:02:09.039 And finally, you may have seen this position before. --> 00:02:10.759 We do not advocate for this. --> 00:02:13.120 By moving your body away from the sled, --> 00:02:15.240 it puts you in a weaker position, --> 00:02:17.159 making it much harder to move the sled --> 00:02:18.360 as the weights increase. --> 00:02:22.000 When programming the sled, --> 00:02:25.039 it's important to remember that all gyms --> 00:02:27.639 will have different carpets and different sleds. --> 00:02:31.639 For this reason, it's very hard for a coach to say, --> 00:02:34.319 but on open weight, but on pro weight, --> 00:02:36.800 because that will vary greatly from gym to gyms. --> 00:02:39.840 I've seen gyms where people can push 600 kilos --> 00:02:42.800 and gyms where people can only push 50 or 60 kilos. --> 00:02:46.599 For that reason, it is probably easier for you as coaches --> 00:02:48.479 to program using a time domain, --> 00:02:50.840 something like 60 seconds of pushing --> 00:02:52.280 to two minutes of rest. --> 00:02:54.800 Think to remember, as with all Hyrox stations, --> 00:02:57.240 the sled push, don't just approach it --> 00:03:00.479 by applying race weight and pushing it for race distance. --> 00:03:02.599 This is probably the main station --> 00:03:03.800 in which you will want to --> 00:03:05.400 incorporate your compromised running --> 00:03:07.960 to train that jelly-legged feeling. --> 00:03:12.039 You'll want to do some runs onto sled push and vice versa. --> 00:03:14.360 In training for sled push, it is important --> 00:03:16.439 to vary your distances and weights --> 00:03:19.520 in order to build power and muscular endurance. --> 00:03:21.879 Do longer, lighter sets, --> 00:03:24.719 and also much heavier, much shorter sets. --> 00:03:26.159 Other things to incorporate --> 00:03:27.719 when training for your sled push. --> 00:03:31.319 We need to think high reps for muscular endurance. --> 00:03:34.159 You can include these over various different exercises, --> 00:03:37.639 leg press, back squats, Romanian rhythm squats, --> 00:03:40.719 all will help you build this for your strong sled push. --> 00:03:43.360 Our top tip for sled push is --> 00:03:44.960 to help your clients understand --> 00:03:47.400 that they need to be disciplined in the sled push. --> 00:03:51.039 To race their own race, stop at the halfway point --> 00:03:54.120 in the lengths and help delay the onset of lactic acid, --> 00:03:56.439 trying to stay efficient for the next run. --> 00:03:59.400 An alternative to training the sled push --> 00:04:00.960 if you don't have access to a sled --> 00:04:03.000 is walking zercher lunges --> 00:04:09.280 or zercher squats. --> 00:04:12.520 From a female perspective, --> 00:04:15.319 the sled push can be slightly daunting. --> 00:04:16.680 Sometimes it can be up to --> 00:04:18.839 three times the female body weight. --> 00:04:20.680 The key as a coach, I think, --> 00:04:23.680 is to install confidence in the clients, --> 00:04:25.959 get them to train heavy, --> 00:04:27.639 get them used to feeling the weight, --> 00:04:29.560 and get them to know that on race day, --> 00:04:30.319 they're gonna move it --> 00:04:31.879 and they're gonna complete the 50 meters. Chapter: Summary Efficiency is Key • Avoid pushing full 12.5-meter lengths to minimize lactic acid buildup. • Break at halfway points to conserve energy. • Vary positions to prevent muscle fatigue and improve transition. Proper Form and Positioning Position 1 • Grip the sled 3–4 inches below the top of the poles. • Maintain a tight body, engage lats, and brace core. • Push off through the calves. Position 2 • Step into the sled with chest over the weights. • Activate glutes and maintain an upright posture for easier breathing. • Avoid lifting the sled base off the ground. Coaching Tips • Program sled push workouts using time domains (e.g., 60 seconds push, 2 minutes rest) due to varying sled weights. • Incorporate compromise running to simulate race-day conditions. • Vary distances and weights to build power and muscular endurance. • Include high-rep exercises (leg press, back squats, Romanian rhythm squats) for muscular endurance. • Emphasize discipline and efficiency during sled push workouts. Alternatives and Female Considerations • Use walking Zurcher lunges or Zurcher squats if a sled is unavailable. • Build confidence in female athletes by training with heavy weights. • Encourage a strong mindset to overcome the initial challenge of pushing heavy loads. Chapter: The biomechanical perspective This workout demands the most raw strength, requiring the athlete to push an object that is often heavier than their own body weight. The effective transfer of force from the feet through to the sled necessitates a firm and stable trunk and upper body. There are two prominent techniques observed: one involves keeping the elbows highly flexed and tucked into the sides of the trunk, pushing with a horizontal forearm, while the other sees the athlete leaning further over the sled, using a vertical forearm for contact. As discussed in Module 2, athletes must adopt a position that maximizes horizontal push force without leaning down on the sled, which would increase its weight and sliding friction. It can be beneficial to drive slightly upward if done at an appropriate angle, as this can enhance horizontal push force, though this is also influenced by the grip provided by the athlete's shoes. For greater efficiency, the thigh should not recover beyond a vertical position, and maintaining shorter step lengths helps to sustain momentum."

Dena and Tom Hogan are here to share their insights on how to maximize efficiency during the Burpee Broad Jump. --> 00:00:09.599 Station 4, the burpee broad jumps. --> 00:00:11.880 There are three main techniques to do the --> 00:00:13.279 burpee broad jumps for Hyrox. --> 00:00:15.839 With this being probably the single --> 00:00:18.960 biggest taxing station for the majority of participants, --> 00:00:22.679 it is important that you show your clients and gym members --> 00:00:25.280 all three techniques, get them to --> 00:00:27.280 practice each and figure out which one --> 00:00:30.920 is best for them. So technique one will be the bunny hop --> 00:00:33.200 technique. This will be the fastest way --> 00:00:35.520 to cover 80 meters but is also the most --> 00:00:37.240 taxing way to cover the 80 meters. --> 00:00:48.359 When doing the bunny hop technique, --> 00:00:50.439 like with all three techniques, it is very --> 00:00:52.600 important to stay low and not --> 00:00:54.520 waste energy on an up and down --> 00:00:58.039 movement. When Dina pops up in --> 00:00:59.520 this loaded position, she should --> 00:01:01.840 instantly jump staying low. She --> 00:01:03.640 lands with her hands very close to --> 00:01:05.799 the ground and goes back into the next movement. --> 00:01:09.319 For the second technique, the step up --> 00:01:11.239 technique, this is probably favored by --> 00:01:13.040 the majority of Hyrox participants. --> 00:01:15.920 This, while not as fast as the bunny hop --> 00:01:18.040 technique, is a lot more efficient over --> 00:01:20.560 the course of 80 meters. To do this, Dina --> 00:01:23.280 will step her foot up all the way up to her fingertips. --> 00:01:28.319 Second foot follows up. Again, in --> 00:01:30.599 this loaded position, she jumps forward. --> 00:01:37.599 And finally, the third technique and --> 00:01:39.359 something that we would tell our clients --> 00:01:43.200 to do if they're either a much bigger athlete or a much --> 00:01:45.079 heavier athlete, this tends to be --> 00:01:46.519 an easier way for them to do the --> 00:01:51.040 full 80 meters. It also allows small breaks on every --> 00:01:53.079 single jump rather than them having to take --> 00:01:56.000 a prolonged 15 to 20 second break, --> 00:01:57.239 maybe halfway through the burpees. --> 00:01:59.359 So to do this, Dina will come up on one --> 00:02:02.040 knee, her foot will then come up to her --> 00:02:05.439 hand, other foot comes up. Again, loaded, we --> 00:02:10.479 jump. Down, again, up onto one knee, foot --> 00:02:14.199 comes up, second foot, and we jump. This is the --> 00:02:16.280 least taxing technique of all three. --> 00:02:18.919 So if your clients are on the bigger --> 00:02:21.439 side, the heavier side, are new to Hyrox, --> 00:02:23.400 this is probably a stepping --> 00:02:25.560 stone to get into that step-up one, --> 00:02:27.840 which is the most efficient way of doing the burpees. --> 00:02:30.840 So everybody has access to burpees --> 00:02:32.840 because it's a full body exercise --> 00:02:34.120 involving just yourself. --> 00:02:36.680 However, as coaches we understand it --> 00:02:40.159 can be quite hard to constantly ask clients to perform --> 00:02:41.879 burpee broad jumps over and over --> 00:02:43.840 again. So we like to mix it up by --> 00:02:45.840 giving them different burpees to do. --> 00:02:49.000 This may involve box jumps, stand-alone, --> 00:02:52.879 just broad jumps. Other things you can do are devil press. --> 00:03:07.840 Just ways to help your clients train --> 00:03:10.080 for burpees without the repetitiveness of --> 00:03:11.840 doing burpees constantly. Two --> 00:03:13.560 common mistakes we regularly see --> 00:03:17.919 under burpees. One, when people land, they land very tall, --> 00:03:20.280 rigid, almost statue-like. What --> 00:03:22.120 happens here now is you have to do a double --> 00:03:23.400 movement to get back to the --> 00:03:26.000 ground and this slows every rep down. --> 00:03:31.560 The second thing is overextending on the jump. --> 00:03:35.479 Really you should be just jumping within yourself. I --> 00:03:36.520 wouldn't be thinking too much --> 00:03:38.919 about how far or how much ground I'm actually covering. --> 00:03:42.560 The best method is just to stand and actually just jump. Chapter: Summary Three Main Techniques • Bunny hop: Fastest but most taxing. Stay low and avoid unnecessary movements. • Step up: Efficient over 80 meters. Step up to fingertips, jump forward. • One-knee technique: Easier for larger or heavier athletes. Allows for breaks on each jump. Alternative Burpee Variations • Box jumps • Standalone broad jumps • Devil press Common Mistakes • Landing tall and rigid: Avoid double movements by staying low. • Overextending on the jump: Focus on controlled jumps rather than distance. Chapter: The biomechanical perspective As easy as it looks, the Burpee Broad Jump workout is technically quite demanding. To avoid any penalties, the 80-meter distance must be covered primarily through the double-leg broad jump, ensuring that the hand position does not advance more than a foot length in front of the feet. While taller athletes may have a slight advantage, the length of each broad jump largely depends on the athlete’s leg power and the effectiveness of their triple extension through the hip, knee, and ankle joints. With anywhere from 50 to 100 or more repetitions, muscular endurance in both the upper and lower body is crucial. For biomechanical efficiency, the focus should be on developing a consistent rhythm rather than attempting maximum distance with each jump. Incorporating an arm swing can increase vertical impulse by about 10%, which enhances leg muscle loading and further benefits from the stretch-shorten cycle. Additionally, maintaining flexibility to bring the feet back to the hand position ensures that no distance is lost with each jump, optimizing overall performance."

    "content": "Titel: Level 1 - Module 6.2 - Summary URL: https://web.lemon-mobile-learning.com/hyrox/#/inhalt/18020 Chapter: Injury Considerations In the context of HYROX, where athletes often push to their physical limits across a series of demanding workouts, understanding and mitigating the risk of injury is crucial for sustained performance and success. Injuries occur when the force exerted on biological tissues exceeds their tolerance levels, causing fibers to stretch beyond their limits and tear. The prevention of such injuries in athletes hinges on two primary biomechanical factors: *stress*, which refers to the amount of eccentric force and the rate at which force is accepted, and *strain*, which is the excessive elongation of muscle fibers. These factors are further influenced by the number of contractions, or repetitions, and the onset of fatigue, where the muscle’s capacity to generate or absorb force becomes compromised. Athletes often fall into the trap of pushing themselves too hard, too quickly, under the outdated “no pain, no gain” mentality. However, tissues require time to adapt and build resilience, making effective recovery strategies crucial. To mitigate injury risks and enhance performance, athletes should focus on several key strategies: developing eccentric strength to manage force loads, enhancing elastic strength through plyometric training to improve the rate of force loading, and ensuring appropriate joint mobility for each exercise to maintain flexibility. Additionally, planning the number of repetitions and gradually increasing load capacity helps build endurance while reducing injury risks. Finally, implementing a comprehensive recovery plan—incorporating rest, mobilization, therapy, nutritional support, and varied training—enables tissues to recover and adapt effectively. Chapter: Summary When training for individual HYROX workouts or integrating them into combined sessions, it’s essential to deeply consider the performance capabilities, or Zubringerleistungen, required for each exercise. While these workouts may serve as valuable training routines for the general gym population, they take on a different significance for competitive HYROX athletes, where they become critical elements of a comprehensive event. This requires a strategic approach to training, where each workout is not only optimized for peak performance in isolation but also carefully considered in the context of how it fits into the overall race strategy. In designing these training sessions, it’s crucial to apply the principles covered in Module 2 and Module 3, ensuring that each session is tailored to address the specific demands of each workout. From a biomechanical perspective, HYROX is an endurance-based race, with each exercise requiring distinct techniques and targeted muscle group engagement. The efficiency of muscle force generation is key, with a focus on optimizing the direction of force application, proper trunk positioning relative to gravity, and the development of elastic qualities to enhance performance and minimize injury risk. Furthermore, the frictional interaction between shoes and surfaces, particularly during sled exercises, is vital for effective force production, making footwear grip an important consideration."

Chapter: Summary Efficiency is Key • The overriding theme for all videos is efficiency. • While faster times can be achieved with higher dampener settings, it’s less efficient for longer workouts. Proper Form and Positioning • Stand 18–24 inches back from the flywheel, feet shoulder-width apart. • Experiment with dampener settings between 3 and 6 to find your optimal setting. • Begin the stroke with a 2–3.25 stroke, followed by a half stroke and then a full stroke. • Engage lats, brace core, hinge through hips, and drive body weight through the stroke. • Inhale at the reach and exhale during the drive. • Avoid full squatting, as it can negatively impact performance. Coaching Tips • Emphasize the importance of efficient skiing for smooth transitions. • Maintain a stroke rate of 35–45 for optimal power and breathing. • Incorporate strength training for triceps, lats, abs, hip flexors, and calves. • Train across all three energy systems (lactic anaerobic, aerobic) for well-rounded development. • On race day, slow down the 1000m by 15–20 seconds to facilitate a smoother transition. Considerations for Females • May need to rely more on calves due to anatomical differences. • May require a slightly higher stroke rate to compensate for lower weight. • Bands can be used as an alternative if a SkiErg is unavailable. Chapter: The biomechanical perspective In this part of the course, we will focus on applying fundamental biomechanical principles to specific HYROX activities, with the goal of enhancing performance, executing movements more efficiently, and reducing the risk of injuries. The 1000m Ski, in particular, can be performed using sound biomechanical principles to improve efficiency and minimize the risk of shoulder injuries: 1.Stance and Positioning: Adopt a wide stance for enhanced stability, positioning your heels as far back on the platform as possible while maintaining good shoulder extension with partial shoulder flexion. This setup optimizes the range of motion needed for an effective pull. 2.Initiating the Pull: Begin the pull by engaging in trunk/hip flexion and knee flexion, keeping the shoulders and elbows fixed. This allows gravity to assist in overcoming the flywheel's inertia, making the initial movement more efficient. 3.Executing the Pull: While bracing the core and keeping the elbows locked, flex the shoulders to pull down and back, and complete the movement by extending the elbows and wrists, guiding the cables toward your thighs. This proximal-to-distal sequencing ensures a smooth and powerful pull. 4.Recovery Phase: For an efficient recovery, keep the movement in the sagittal plane, following the most direct path back to the starting position. Avoid the “butterfly” motion by reversing the order of the pull—starting with elbow flexion, followed by shoulder extension, hip extension, and knee extension. 5.Resistance and Efficiency: Set an appropriate resistance that allows you to balance distance per stroke (force) with stroke rate (velocity). You should feel some initial resistance at the start of each pull, which indicates that the resistance is set correctly for your performance needs. By incorporating these principles into the 1000m Ski technique, the athlete can enhance overall efficiency and significantly reduce the likelihood of injury, particularly to the shoulders."

Chapter: Summary A Notorious Challenge • Sandbag lunges are a sticking point for most HYROX athletes due to late-race fatigue. • Train lunges under fatigue and compromise conditions. Technique Variations • Step-through: Fastest but most taxing, one step after another. • Stutter step: More popular, involves a small break between repetitions for easier execution. Training Tips • Drop sets: Train with progressively lighter weights to replicate race-day fatigue. • Alternate exercises: Sandbag lunges on treadmill, walking lunges off erg machines or sled push. • Mental strategy: Chunk reps (e.g., 5 step-through, 5 stutter step) instead of focusing on total distance. ⸻ Programming Recommendations • Include one-legged exercises: Bulgarian split squats, single-leg RDLs, weighted box step-ups. • Alternative for sandbags: Front rack dumbbell lunges. Chapter: The biomechanical perspective From a biomechanical perspective, effective lunge performance relies not only on the strength of the quadriceps and glute muscles but also on several critical factors such as flexibility in the hips, knees, and ankles, postural control, and the precise distance of the lunge step (foot placement). From a biomechanical perspective, while strong quadriceps and glute muscles are essential for executing lunges effectively, several other factors play a critical role in determining lunge performance and efficiency. Flexibility in the hips, knees, and ankles, along with postural control and the distance of the step or lunge (foot placement), are key limiting factors. Over-reaching in the lunge step can create a challenging position that requires greater muscular effort to recover from, as illustrated by Athlete A. In this scenario, the forward inclination of the shin and the increased distance the center of mass (including the sandbag) must travel over the front toes significantly heighten the physical demand. In contrast, Athlete B demonstrates a more efficient lunge by opting for a shorter step distance, where the trunk is inclined further forward, and the front foot is positioned closer to the center of mass, resulting in a backward inclination of the shin. This approach minimizes the muscular effort needed, thereby improving overall lunge efficiency."

00:00:14.119 where we're seated, a lot of people will look at this --> 00:00:17.519 as almost a rest station, but it's important to impress --> 00:00:19.559 upon your clients that this is not the case. --> 00:00:23.000 Yes, we will want our heart rate to lower on this station --> 00:00:25.639 in readiness to attack the back half of the race, --> 00:00:28.559 but we can do this through good technique on the rower --> 00:00:30.800 while still maintaining a good pace. --> 00:00:34.599 Like the skier, the dampness setting plays a huge role --> 00:00:36.039 in our one kilometer row. --> 00:00:38.639 If we put the dampness setting up to 10, --> 00:00:40.719 no doubt we will row a lot faster, --> 00:00:42.400 but here we need efficiency --> 00:00:44.480 ready to lead onto our next run. --> 00:00:48.159 In general, most athletes will need a set in again --> 00:00:49.480 between four and seven. --> 00:00:53.880 The single biggest factor as coaches for programming row --> 00:00:57.360 is to talk to your clients how it differs vastly --> 00:01:02.519 from just rowing 1K to rowing 1K within a Hyrox race. --> 00:01:06.239 The technique will look very, very different. --> 00:01:09.000 So traditional rowing will see us being --> 00:01:11.360 about 60% leg dominant. --> 00:01:16.559 However, when we want to roll for Hyrox, --> 00:01:18.400 we need to nearly flip the script --> 00:01:22.159 and make it much more an upper body exercise. --> 00:01:25.920 The reason for this, of course, the back end of the race --> 00:01:27.599 is very leg dominant. --> 00:01:30.400 100 meters of lunges, 100 wall balls. --> 00:01:34.480 We need to use as much now of our upper body as possible. --> 00:01:38.039 As coaches, it's really important to install --> 00:01:39.960 a few key factors in the clients --> 00:01:42.079 so that they get this good technique --> 00:01:43.599 for their Hyrox row. --> 00:01:48.320 First couple of things are sitting tall in the rower, --> 00:01:52.360 shoulders in front of the hips, --> 00:01:56.880 arms staying long and hands staying loose. --> 00:02:00.559 Notice how the shins stay vertical. --> 00:02:04.320 And then finally, on the last of the pole, --> 00:02:07.119 a real hinge from the hips. --> 00:02:11.320 Again, stroke rate is a huge factor for the roll. --> 00:02:16.039 Most men will be somewhat optimal between 25 and 35. --> 00:02:20.800 The females may be somewhere between 30 to 35, 40. --> 00:02:24.559 Like the SkiErg, we train the rower --> 00:02:26.039 over the three energy systems. --> 00:02:28.840 Allactic anaerobic work we program --> 00:02:30.719 on the end of our strength days. --> 00:02:32.639 So if we do a leg strength day, --> 00:02:36.320 we will do 10 by 125 meter rows at the end, --> 00:02:39.239 or 10 by 20 calorie rows at the end, --> 00:02:41.800 with 90 seconds to two minutes recovery between each. --> 00:02:45.840 Our lactic anaerobic work we do, as we said before, --> 00:02:47.559 within our mech cons or within workouts. --> 00:02:52.920 This could be 10, 15, 20 rounds of work, 200 to 300 meters, --> 00:02:56.199 and is usually done with another high rocks movement. --> 00:02:58.679 We would usually program the aerobic work --> 00:03:01.760 within org workouts, where we would do typically --> 00:03:06.480 a 2K bike org into a 1K SkiErg into a 1K RowErg. --> 00:03:08.599 We would do four or five rounds of this, --> 00:03:11.800 where our clients are just working that aerobic base, --> 00:03:13.199 building that aerobic fitness. --> 00:03:17.719 So the tips for the RowErg is the same as the ski. --> 00:03:20.719 Typically you need to slow it down about 10 seconds --> 00:03:25.199 for 500 of what you would do your standalone 1K row in. --> 00:03:28.440 Another thing to really bring home to your clients is, --> 00:03:31.440 any traditional method or technique of rowing --> 00:03:33.559 really needs to be forgotten. --> 00:03:37.440 And now you need to take home the Hyrox method --> 00:03:40.519 of flipping the script and using a 60% --> 00:03:43.239 upper body dominant technique. --> 00:03:46.440 So as a coach, I have found that women --> 00:03:49.360 typically find the row work a little bit harder --> 00:03:51.679 than the male clients I have. --> 00:03:55.559 I personally also find the row work a little bit testing, --> 00:03:59.639 purely because of leverage, my height and weight ratio. --> 00:04:03.000 And the thing to remember is, is the beauty of Hyrox --> 00:04:05.280 is always a place where we can make up time --> 00:04:07.960 if we lose a few seconds on a particular station. --> 00:04:10.960 Unfortunately, there is no real replacement --> 00:04:15.480 or exercises to do specifically for row technique. --> 00:04:19.199 However, building a strong back, building strong legs --> 00:04:21.679 will also go a long way to helping you achieve --> 00:04:22.559 the row you want. --> 00:04:26.280 Also to remember to somewhat extent, erg is erg. --> 00:04:28.119 So if you're programming workouts --> 00:04:30.920 and people don't have access to the row, --> 00:04:34.119 simply ask them to replace it with ski or bike. Chapter: Summary Importance of Efficiency • Avoid treating the row as a rest station. • Maintain a good pace while conserving energy for the back half of the race. • Adjust dampener settings for optimal efficiency (4–7). ⸻ Technique Differences • Traditional vs. HYROX: Shift focus from leg dominance to upper body dominance. • Key factors: Sit tall, shoulders in front of hips, long arms, loose hands, vertical shins, hip hinge. Programming Tips • Stroke rate: 25–35 for men, 30–40 for women. • Energy system training: • Lactic anaerobic: 10×125 m or 10×20k rows with recovery. • Lactic anaerobic: Metcons or workouts with 10–20 rounds of 200–300 m. • Aerobic: Erg workouts with 4–5 rounds of 2k bike, 1k ski, 1k row. Tips for Rowing • Slow down by 10 seconds per 500 m compared to a standalone 1k row. • Focus on the HYROX-specific technique. Considerations for Female Athletes • May find the row more challenging due to leverage and height-to-weight ratio. • Remember that HYROX allows for making up time on other stations. Alternatives • While no exact replacements exist, building a strong back and legs can help. • Substitute with SkiErg or BikeErg if necessary. Chapter: The biomechanical perspective When rowing on an ergometer, there are three key points of contact: the feet, the seat, and the hands on the handle. The goal is to efficiently transfer all muscular effort into the handle by selecting a resistance level that balances distance per stroke with stroke frequency. The rowing motion is a coordinated effort involving both a push from the legs (leg drive) and a pull with the arms, all of which are connected and stabilized by the torso. In the starting position, with the trunk leaning forward, knees flexed, and arms extended with a relaxed, cupped grip on the handle, the initial leg drive must be synchronized with a pull on the handle. The trunk acts as a stable platform to effectively transfer the power generated by the legs to the handle. A common mistake is allowing the seat to move backward without corresponding movement of the handle, indicating a loss of connection between the leg drive and the upper body pull. As momentum builds in the handle, the hips extend, and the trunk leans back while the shoulders and elbows remain extended. The rowing stroke is completed as the handle is pulled into the chest. The recovery phase should be relaxed and take as long as the drive, reversing the order of movements: first extending the elbows, then flexing the trunk, and finally allowing the knees to flex only after the handle has passed beyond them. The handle should follow a straight path throughout. If the resistance at the start feels minimal, the setting is likely too low; conversely, if the biceps are overly engaged, the resistance may be set too high. Proper resistance ensures that the entire body contributes effectively to the rowing stroke, optimizing performance."

Chapter: Summary Efficiency and Technique *Body position: Proud chest, shoulders back, loose grip. *Focus on speed: Quick movement minimizes breaks and rest time. *Muscle group training: Suitcase carries, upright rows, plate pinches, dead hangs. Programming Considerations *Prioritize other stations: Spend time on stations where improvements can yield significant gains. *Incorporate into workouts: Include 50 meters of Farmers Carry as a break between other stations. Female Considerations *Use the same kettlebell size but adjust weight. *Be mindful of the bulkiness and knee impact. *Focus on speed and efficiency to avoid breaks. Alternative Equipment *Use dumbbells as a substitute for kettlebells. Chapter: The biomechanical perspective The challenge with the Farmer's Carry lies in making the exercise as relaxed and efficient as possible. It is crucial to avoid overstriding, as placing the foot too far in front of or behind the center of mass increases the demand on postural control and pelvic stability. For athletes aiming to increase their walking speed, the initial focus should be on step frequency, as this keeps the feet closer to the body and reduces the time between periods of double foot support, thereby enhancing dynamic stability. Athletes who have developed exceptional postural control and pelvic stability can further improve their speed by incorporating an arm swing that engages transverse trunk rotation, making the walking gait more natural and fluid."

really need to do these under fatigue. --> 00:00:38.639 So a session that we will do a lot of is, --> 00:00:40.440 if we do running intervals on the treadmill, --> 00:00:43.400 after the last interval and before a cool down, --> 00:00:46.320 we will get our clients to do 100 wall balls per time. --> 00:00:48.920 Approaching the wall balls, arms length, --> 00:00:52.039 under the target, feet under our shoulders, --> 00:00:53.679 create our strong base, --> 00:00:56.760 and we get ready for to begin our wall balls. --> 00:00:59.519 The biggest thing here is hand placement. --> 00:01:02.960 Five and seven is optimal to take the stress --> 00:01:04.559 and pressure off the shoulders. --> 00:01:08.280 Three and a nine is gonna lead to fatigue earlier on --> 00:01:09.800 in the set than we hoped for. --> 00:01:13.920 Three points of contact, the two hands and the chin. --> 00:01:17.079 We wanna proud chest, we wanna always look up, --> 00:01:19.119 and as we drop, we inhale, --> 00:01:21.320 and as we come up out of the --> 00:01:23.119 squat for our throw, we exhale. --> 00:01:26.559 A big mistake people make is the rolling forward, --> 00:01:28.039 and it's why we have talked about --> 00:01:29.519 the three points of contact. --> 00:01:31.719 Because the more you roll forward with the ball, --> 00:01:34.960 the more the hips rise, and this leads to not breaking --> 00:01:37.039 parallel and receiving no reps. --> 00:01:38.800 So training for the wall balls. --> 00:01:42.199 Some very good ways to train wall balls are using emoms, --> 00:01:44.800 where we will try to get 20 reps every minute --> 00:01:45.920 for maybe 10 minutes. --> 00:01:48.079 Another one, as we mentioned --> 00:01:49.559 earlier with the sandbag lunges, --> 00:01:51.400 we can do drop sets with the wall balls. --> 00:01:54.639 So if your clients can't do 100 wall balls --> 00:01:58.239 with a nine kg ball, we can do max reps with a nine kg. --> 00:02:00.119 When they need to put that down, --> 00:02:03.280 max reps with a six kg, they need to put that down, --> 00:02:05.159 and then we'll try to get the remainder of the 100 --> 00:02:06.360 with a three kg ball. --> 00:02:10.239 Just as it is important to train running compromise, --> 00:02:13.119 training your stations like wall balls compromised --> 00:02:15.760 will also be hugely beneficial for your clients. --> 00:02:18.760 Something as simple as going from a 1k run --> 00:02:21.360 straight into 30 wall balls unbroken, --> 00:02:23.679 one minute's rest, five rounds. --> 00:02:26.639 Wall balls may be perceived as a shoulder exercise, --> 00:02:28.239 but if form is correct, it is --> 00:02:30.039 actually a full body exercise. --> 00:02:32.679 So driving through that whole body --> 00:02:35.320 will achieve maximum results. --> 00:02:37.880 Incorporating shoulder exercises --> 00:02:40.119 will definitely help with wall balls, --> 00:02:43.039 but not to forget that if done correctly, --> 00:02:46.079 wall balls is an overall full body exercise. --> 00:02:49.880 So gym fitness and gym strength in general will help. --> 00:02:53.320 So an alternative to wall balls is thrusters, --> 00:02:54.880 but not only is this good --> 00:02:56.880 if you don't have wall ball access, --> 00:02:59.840 sometimes it's great to just incorporate thrusters --> 00:03:00.920 at your treadmill. --> 00:03:03.519 So again, you can eliminate that dead time --> 00:03:05.880 and get used to that high rocks feeling --> 00:03:09.480 of going straight from a run to an exercise compromised. --> 00:03:12.960 Wall balls is where female athletes at the moment --> 00:03:13.840 are excelling. --> 00:03:15.400 We can see them in the elite ladies, --> 00:03:18.519 where the vast majority of them are now going unbroken --> 00:03:21.239 compared to the male elite 15 athletes. --> 00:03:23.559 Also, it's a good point to remember --> 00:03:25.159 that if you're doing mixed doubles, --> 00:03:29.239 although the 6kg ball remains for both the male and female, --> 00:03:31.119 it is generally quicker for the ladies --> 00:03:33.920 to take the vast majority of the wall balls --> 00:03:36.079 as they can get down and back up quicker --> 00:03:37.519 with the lower target. Chapter: Summary Importance of Technique • Proper technique can significantly improve performance and save time. • Train wall balls under fatigued conditions to simulate race-day experience. ⸻ Technique Tips • Hand placement: Five and seven is optimal, avoid three and nine. • Body position: Three points of contact (hands, chin), proud chest, look up. • Avoid rolling forward: Maintain a strong base and break parallel for effective reps. ⸻ Training Methods • EMOMs: Perform 20 reps every minute for 10 minutes. • Drop sets: Decrease weight with each set to simulate fatigue. • Compromise training: Combine wall balls with running intervals or other exercises. ⸻ Muscle Groups • Wall balls are a full-body exercise, not just shoulders. • Incorporate general gym fitness and strength training for overall improvement. ⸻ Alternatives • Thrusters can be used as a substitute for wall balls, especially for those without wall ball access. ⸻ Female Athletes • Female athletes often excel at wall balls due to quicker movements and lower target height. • In mixed doubles, consider having the female athlete perform most wall balls. Chapter: The biomechanical perspective We have previously examined the biomechanical principles underlying the wall balls exercise, emphasizing that the primary objective is to generate sufficient vertical velocity in the wall ball through a coordinated sequence of proximal-to-distal movements. This process can be broken down into three distinct phases: 1. The Countermovement: Involves flexing the hips and knees to lower the center of mass, ensuring the hips descend below the knees. 2. The Leg Drive: Entails extending the hips and knees from the lowest position to full extension, propelling the body upward. 3. The Ball Drive: Involves accelerating the ball upwards from the chest to the point of release. Executing the countermovement and leg drive as a continuous motion triggers the stretch-shortening cycle, which enhances the acceleration of both the body and the ball. This stretch-shortening enhancement is optimized through targeted eccentric strength and plyometric training. The timing of the ball drive is crucial; it should seamlessly follow the leg drive to fully capitalize on the momentum generated. Any pause between the squat and ball drive will disrupt this momentum, making it more challenging for the athlete to reach the target height."

Chapter: Summary Programming Recommendations • Minimum 3 runs per week: interval, compromised, and endurance sessions. • Consider time constraints and individual preferences. ⸻ Outdoor vs. Treadmill Outdoor • Pros: Connect with your body, learn running pace. • Cons: Affected by weather and terrain, making pace maintenance difficult. Treadmill • Pros: Ideal for compromised running, minimal transition time, consistent pacing, softer on legs. • Cons: Can be boring, less accurate representation of outdoor running pace. ⸻ Optimal Approach • Combine both: Incorporate outdoor and treadmill running into training for a well-rounded approach. Chapter: The biomechanical perspective Of course : Running plays a crucial role in HYROX, as it helps to restore oxygen to your muscles between the more anaerobic workouts. In this context, you can consider running almost as part of your recovery strategy between the high-intensity exercises - depending on the performance level of the athlete of course To make the running intervals more efficient, consider optimizing the gait pattern with the following points: 1.Slight Forward Trunk Lean: Maintain a slight forward lean in your trunk to improve running efficiency and reduce strain. 2.Flat Foot Planting: Plant your foot flat under the body with some flexion in the knee, which helps avoid unnecessary braking forces. 3.Utilize the Stretch-Shortening Cycle (SSC): Leverage the SSC in your quadriceps, patella, and Achilles tendons to store and release energy in each step, making your running more energy-efficient. 4.Front Side Recovery: Focus on front side recovery, bringing your heel up and thigh forward to fall into each step, utilizing gravity to your advantage. 5.Include Specific Training: Incorporate eccentric strength training and plyometric drills into your routine to enhance your elastic qualities, further improving your running efficiency and resilience. By applying these principles, you can optimize running technique, making it a more effective component of the overall HYROX performance."

These phases, each with specific objectives and training focuses, collectively contribute to the athlete's peak performance. This chapter outlines the primary phases of training—General Preparation, Specific Preparation, Pre-Competition, Competition, and Transition—drawing on the expertise of sports scientists to highlight their significance and application. The General Preparation Phase (GPP) lays the foundation for subsequent training phases, emphasizing the development of a broad base of conditioning, strength, and technical skills. Bompa & Carrera (2015) emphasize the importance of this phase, stating, \"The GPP is crucial for building the athlete’s capacity for work and preparing the body for the stresses of more intense, specific training.\" During this phase, athletes engage in a variety of general conditioning activities designed to improve overall fitness and resilience. Following the GPP, the Specific Preparation Phase (SPP) involves more focused training activities that are closely related to the athlete's sport-specific demands. This phase aims to translate the general capacities developed in the GPP into sport-specific skills and performance capabilities. Zatsiorsky & Kraemer (2006) note, \"The SPP is where athletes begin to refine their abilities in a manner that is directly applicable to their sport, focusing on specific energy systems and technical skills.\" The Pre-Competition Phase serves as a bridge between the SPP and the Competition Phase, fine-tuning the athlete's form and ensuring readiness for competition. It involves the integration of competition-specific strategies and mental preparation. According to Stone et al. (2007), \"This phase is critical for the psychological and technical preparation of the athlete, optimizing performance levels through simulation of competitive environments.\" The Competition Phase is when the athlete applies their training in actual competitive situations. The focus shifts to maintaining peak performance, with minimal increases in fitness. Muller et al. (2015) describe this phase as \"a period characterized by high-intensity, low-volume training designed to maximize performance while reducing the risk of overtraining.\" Example: During competition, the soccer player's training would be tailored to recovery and tactical adjustments based on upcoming opponents, with an emphasis on maintaining peak physical and psychological state. Post-competition, athletes enter the Transition Phase, also known as the off-season or recovery phase. This period allows for physical and psychological recovery from the demands of training and competition. Bompa & Buzzichelli (2019) highlight its necessity, stating, \"The transition phase is essential for mental rest, recovery, and preparation for the next training cycle, preventing burnout and overtraining.\" And anyone who's ever played a sport—whether it’s basketball, soccer, or track and field—knows the feeling: sometimes you just want to mix things up, take a little break from your usual routine. It’s like hitting the reset button so that when the new season rolls around, you're pumped and ready to tackle new challenges, ideas, and training methods to boost your performance. Incorporating these phases into the training program enables athletes to systematically progress towards peak performance, with each phase building upon the last. The strategic manipulation of training focus, intensity, and volume throughout these phases ensures the athlete's development is optimized, culminating in peak performance for competition. To enhance Chapter 4 with a nuanced discussion on the differences in periodization strategies between team and individual sports, let's introduce a subchapter titled \"Periodization for Team Sports vs. Individual Sports.\" This section will delve into the unique challenges and considerations for designing periodized training programs across these two broad categories, drawing on expert insights and literature to illustrate key points."

Chapter: History of Periodization of Training The concept of periodization in sports has its origins in the early 20th century, but it was during the mid-1900s that it truly began to take shape, thanks to the groundbreaking work of Eastern European scientists and coaches. Figures like Russian physiologist Leo Matveyev, Hungarian coaches István Javorek were instrumental in refining periodization as a sophisticated, adaptable framework for optimizing athletic training. These pioneers recognized the limitations of generic training programs and introduced periodization as a method to tailor training regimens to the individual needs and goals of athletes. Historically, periodization was more than just a method for organizing training; it represented a holistic approach to athletic development. By strategically varying key training variables—such as intensity, volume, and specificity—periodization was designed to prevent performance plateaus, reduce the risk of overuse injuries, and ensure continual progress. This systematic approach enabled athletes to develop a range of physiological systems, including endurance, strength, speed, and agility, thereby ensuring comprehensive physical preparedness for competition. Today, the principles of periodization continue to evolve, thanks to the contributions of contemporary sports scientists and experts like Tudor Bompa, often referred to as the \"father of periodization\" in the Western world, and Vladimir Issurin, a leading authority on block periodization. Istvan Balyi is also widely recognized for his work on the Long-Term Athlete Development (LTAD) model, which integrates periodization principles to guide athletes from early development through to peak performance. This is a special topic which we will cover in the HYROX365 Academy Level 2 course “HYROX Youngstars”. In recent years, researchers like Greg Haff and Mike Stone have made significant contributions to the field. Greg Haff has focused on the practical applications of periodization in strength and conditioning, particularly within resistance training. Mike Stone, known for his work in strength and power development, has contributed extensively to the understanding of how periodization impacts athletic performance and adaptation.

While these concepts are widely accepted, they didn’t just come from one source. Instead, they’ve developed over time, shaped by thorough research and hands-on experience, becoming essential tools for fitness pros, sports scientists, and coaches around the globe. These general training principles lay the groundwork for effective programs across a wide range of sports and fitness disciplines. They provide a framework that helps athletes and coaches craft programs that boost performance, enhance recovery, and promote long-term athletic development. These principles include: 1. Specificity Training should be relevant and appropriate to the sport or goals of the athlete. Specific exercises and routines are designed to develop particular skills and fitness components needed for the activity. 2. Overload For improvements to occur, the training stimulus must be greater than what the body is accustomed to. This can be achieved by increasing the intensity, duration, or frequency of training. 3.Progression To continue making gains, the training stimulus must progressively increase over time. This involves gradually increasing the workload to avoid plateaus and to keep the body challenged. 4.Reversibility Fitness gains are reversible, meaning if training ceases or intensity reduces significantly, the gains will be lost. This principle highlights the importance of consistent training to maintain fitness levels. 5.Individuality Training programs should be tailored to the individual athlete's needs, abilities, and goals. Factors such as age, gender, fitness level, and personal preferences should be considered. 6.Adaptation The body adapts to the demands placed on it. Through regular training, physiological changes occur, allowing the athlete to become more efficient and capable. 7.Recovery Adequate rest and recovery are essential for the body to repair and strengthen. Training programs must include rest periods to prevent overtraining and injury. 8.Variety Incorporating a range of exercises and training modalities can prevent boredom, reduce the risk of overuse injuries, and enhance overall fitness by working different muscle groups. 9.Balance Ensuring a well-rounded program that addresses all aspects of fitness, including strength, endurance, flexibility, and mental well-being, is crucial for overall athletic development. 10.Periodization Organizing training into cycles or phases helps manage workload and optimize performance. Periodization involves varying the training focus at different times, such as building a base, increasing intensity, and tapering before competitions."

This chapter elaborates on the primary periodization models—Linear, Non-linear (Undulating), Block, and Conjugate—incorporating insights and quotes from eminent sports scientists to underscore their relevance and application in athletic training. 1. Linear Periodization, characterized by a progressive increase in intensity and a decrease in volume, is foundational in sports science. Tudor Bompa, often considered the father of periodization asserts, \"Systematic variation of volume and intensity over time is the most effective way to achieve peak performance\" (Bompa & Haff, 2009). This model structures training into macrocycles, mesocycles, and microcycles, facilitating gradual adaptation. Example: In preparing for a marathon, an athlete might initially focus on building endurance through long, slow runs, progressively integrating more intense, race-pace sessions as the competition nears, exemplifying Bompa's principle of periodization. 2. Non-linear Periodization advocates for varying training intensity and volume frequently within a cycle, aiming to stimulate continuous adaptation. Stone et al. (2000) highlight its benefits: \"Undulating periodization allows for a greater variation in stimuli, potentially enhancing the adaptive response to training.\" This model is beneficial for athletes seeking to improve multiple performance qualities simultaneously. Example: A strength athlete might alternate between high-intensity, moderate, and low-intensity training days throughout a week to target different strength qualities, in line with Stone's recommendation for varied stimuli. 3. Block Periodization focuses training on specific physiological targets within distinct blocks, an approach particularly suited to athletes with complex training needs. Issurin (2010) defines it as \"a structure consisting of sequential blocks, each with a concentrated focus on a limited number of training targets.\" This model is optimal for managing the multifaceted demands of elite sports performance. Example: For an elite swimmer, a preparatory block might concentrate on aerobic base-building and technique, followed by a block dedicated to strength and power, culminating in a competition block focusing on race-specific skills, aligning with Issurin's block periodization framework. Creating periodized training plans for HYROX athletes often requires blending elements from various periodization models—Linear, Non-linear (Undulating), and Block Periodization. Each model offers valuable insights and methods to prepare athletes for peak performance. However, one crucial factor we must never overlook is that, unlike general training where ongoing improvement is the goal, HYROX athletes are primarily preparing to perform at their absolute best on a specific date or weekend. This means while we might use a combination of these periodization types, our focus remains on ensuring that every aspect of the training program is aligned to have the athlete peak precisely when it counts. Whether it's building a solid foundation with Linear Periodization, introducing varied stimuli with Non-linear approaches, or honing in on specific performance aspects with Block Periodization, the ultimate objective is to ensure that when the race day arrives, the athlete is fully prepared to deliver their best performance."

    "content": "Titel: Level 1 - Module 7 - Tailoring Training Programs for HYROX URL: https://web.lemon-mobile-learning.com/hyrox/#/inhalt/18006 Chapter: Tailoring Training Programs for HYROX In the world of athletic training, periodization is a cornerstone strategy that has been meticulously developed and refined over time to maximize performance and ensure athletes reach their peak condition at the right moments. Whether in endurance sports, strength and power disciplines, or team sports, the nuances of periodization are crucial for crafting effective training regimens that cater to the specific demands of each sport. For athletes involved in HYROX, a sport that uniquely blends endurance and strength endurance, understanding and applying periodization principles is essential for optimizing performance. Chapter: The Importance of Sport-Specific Periodization Periodization strategies must be tailored to the unique demands and competitive schedules of different sports to achieve the best possible outcomes. While the foundational principles of periodization remain consistent—progressive overload, recovery, and variation—the way these principles are applied can vary significantly depending on the sport. This article explores the application of periodization in endurance sports, strength and power sports, and, by extension, how these principles can be adapted for the hybrid demands of HYROX. Chapter: Periodization in Endurance Sports Endurance sports such as long-distance running, cycling, and swimming require athletes to develop high levels of aerobic capacity, endurance, and efficient energy management. Periodized training programs for endurance athletes typically involve distinct phases designed to progressively build up these attributes while avoiding overtraining. For example, a marathon runner might begin their periodized training plan with a base phase focused on low-intensity, high-volume workouts to build a strong aerobic foundation. This phase could last several months and is crucial for establishing the endurance needed for long-distance events. Following this, the intensity phase introduces more intense threshold and interval workouts aimed at increasing speed and efficiency. Finally, a tapering phase—where training volume is significantly reduced while maintaining intensity—ensures the athlete peaks at the right time for competition. This tapering strategy, as highlighted by Mujika and Padilla, is vital in endurance sports to allow full recovery and supercompensation, leading to optimal race-day performance. For a HYROX athlete, the principles of endurance periodization are equally important. Given the event’s endurance demands, incorporating a similar periodization approach, with phases focused on building aerobic capacity and tapering before competition, can help athletes maintain high performance throughout the grueling series of HYROX exercises. Chapter: Periodization in Strength and Power Sports Strength and power sports, such as weightlifting and sprinting, require a different approach to periodization. Here, the focus shifts from endurance to developing maximal strength, power, and explosive capabilities. According to Kraemer and Ratamess, effective periodization for strength and power involves manipulating exercise volume, intensity, and frequency across different phases, each building upon the last. A typical periodized training program for a weightlifter might start with a hypertrophy phase, aimed at increasing muscle mass. This is followed by a strength phase, where the focus is on converting muscle size into raw strength. Next, the program moves into a power phase, emphasizing explosive movements that are critical for sports like weightlifting and sprinting. Finally, a peaking phase ensures that the athlete reaches their maximum strength and power output just in time for competition. For HYROX athletes, integrating these principles is essential due to the sport’s combination of endurance and strength endurance. A HYROX athlete’s periodization plan might include phases that build muscular endurance alongside explosive strength, ensuring they can handle both the repetitive endurance tasks and the heavy lifting components of the event. Chapter: Integrating Periodization for HYROX Athletes HYROX presents a unique challenge because it combines elements of both endurance and strength endurance. As such, periodization for HYROX athletes must balance these two components effectively. A comprehensive periodized training program for HYROX might include: 1. Endurance Phase: Similar to the base phase in traditional endurance sports, this phase would focus on building aerobic capacity and muscular endurance through high-volume, moderate-intensity workouts. 2. Strength Endurance Phase: Following the endurance base, this phase would incorporate exercises aimed at improving the athlete’s ability to sustain strength over time. This might include circuit training with moderate weights and higher repetitions, simulating the demands of HYROX events. 3. Power and Speed Phase: Closer to competition, the focus would shift to enhancing power and speed, particularly in the exercises that require explosive movements, such as sled pulls and kettlebell swings. 4. Tapering Phase: Just as in endurance sports, a tapering phase before a HYROX competition is crucial. Reducing volume while maintaining intensity allows for recovery, ensuring the athlete is in peak condition on race day. By understanding and applying the principles of periodization, coaches can optimize their training to meet the sport’s unique demands. Whether improving their aerobic capacity, developing strength endurance, or fine-tuning power and speed, a well-structured periodized plan is key to achieving success in this demanding hybrid sport. This nuanced approach to training program design across different age groups highlights the importance of age-appropriate considerations to ensure safe, effective, and enjoyable physical activity experiences that promote lifelong health and athletic development. Adjustments for overtraining and undertraining are critical considerations within the periodized plan, necessitating a delicate balance to ensure athletes are neither pushed beyond their recovery capabilities nor left under-stimulated. Overtraining, characterized by a persistent decrement in performance and physiological function due to excessive training load without adequate recovery, poses significant risks to the athlete's health and performance longevity. Detecting early signs of overtraining through vigilant monitoring and feedback allows for timely interventions, such as reducing training intensity, increasing recovery periods, or incorporating rest days, thus preventing the onset of more severe symptoms and facilitating a return to optimal training and performance levels. Conversely, undertraining, which results from insufficient training stimuli to elicit desired adaptations, can be addressed by incrementally increasing training load, intensity, or specificity, ensuring the athlete continues to progress towards their performance goals. The strategic management of training load, encompassing the adjustments for overtraining and undertraining, underscores the importance of individualized training prescriptions. Each athlete's response to training stimuli is unique, influenced by factors such as genetics, previous training history, and current life stressors. Therefore, the periodized training plan must be fluid, adapting to the evolving needs and feedback from the athlete to foster optimal performance improvements. As emphasized by Meeusen et al. (2013), the prevention and management of overtraining require a collaborative approach, integrating insights from the athlete, coaching staff, and medical professionals to ensure a holistic and effective response to the signs of maladaptation. In essence, the successful implementation of periodized training hinges on the effective use of performance assessments to establish benchmarks, the employment of comprehensive feedback mechanisms to monitor ongoing responses, and the judicious adjustments for overtraining and undertraining to maintain a trajectory of progressive improvement. This dynamic interplay between assessment, feedback, and adjustment ensures that the training program remains aligned with the athlete's current capabilities and future aspirations, embodying a responsive and athlete-centered approach to achieving peak performance."

By now, you’ve probably realized that designing training programs isn’t just about throwing together some weights, reps, or miles—it’s a far more complex task. My goal has been to equip you with practical tools for planning and periodizing HYROX training. A knowledgeable, creative, and enthusiastic coach is essential to crafting a personalized training program that truly meets the needs of the athlete. Below, you’ll find two case studies that explore how one might approach the planning process for a middle-distance runner and a long jumper. However, it’s important to remember that HYROX has its own unique profile, so while the periodization model might share similarities with other sports, it won’t be exactly the same. These case studies dive into the nuanced application of periodization, offering insights into the strategic implementation of training programs tailored to the distinct demands of track and field events. They also highlight the lessons learned and best practices that come from carefully planning and executing these programs. 1. The Middle-Distance Runner The first case study examines a middle-distance runner specializing in the 800m and 1500m events, disciplines that require a delicate balance between aerobic endurance and anaerobic speed. Interestingly, HYROX shares a similar profile when it comes to the primary energy systems required, blending both aerobic and anaerobic capacities to optimize performance. The athlete's periodized program was structured around a macrocycle leading up to the national championships, comprising distinct phases tailored to develop specific physiological capacities. The initial phase focused on building an aerobic base, employing long, slow runs and cross-training activities to enhance cardiovascular efficiency without imposing excessive anaerobic stress. This approach aligns with the principles outlined by Billat et al. (2001), who emphasize the importance of aerobic base development in middle-distance running for improving endurance and facilitating recovery. As the macrocycle progressed, the focus shifted towards the introduction of higher-intensity interval training and tempo runs, designed to improve lactate threshold and VO2 max, critical determinants of performance in middle-distance events. This phase of training leveraged the concept of specificity, gradually simulating race conditions and intensities to adapt the athlete's physiological and psychological responses to the demands of competition. The tapering phase, implemented in the weeks leading up to the championships, reduced training volume while maintaining intensity, optimizing the athlete's physiological and mental readiness for peak performance. The successful outcome of this periodized approach was evidenced by the athlete achieving personal best times in both events, underscoring the efficacy of a well-structured periodization plan that systematically develops relevant performance capacities. 2. The Long Jump Specialist Transitioning into the pre-competitive and competitive phases, the program increasingly prioritized sport-specific technical drills and speed work, refining the athlete's approach run, take-off technique, and flight mechanics. Sprint training sessions were interspersed with technical long jump sessions, ensuring the athlete's speed and power directly translated into jumping performance. The strategic manipulation of training volume and intensity, guided by ongoing performance assessments and athlete feedback, facilitated peak performance during key competitions. The athlete's notable improvement in jump distance throughout the season exemplified the success of the periodized training plan, highlighting the critical role of specificity and progressive overload in optimizing technical and physical capacities in field events. These case studies from track and field illustrate the practical application and tangible benefits of periodized training programs, tailored to the specific demands of middle-distance running and long jump events. Through careful planning, execution, and adjustment of training phases, these athletes achieved significant performance improvements, demonstrating the value of periodization in translating training efforts into competitive success. The lessons learned from these examples emphasize the importance of individualization, specificity, and the strategic progression of training loads in fostering athletic development and peak performance."

This examination not only sheds light on the complexities and debates surrounding periodization but also underscores the dynamic nature of sports science, where continuous inquiry and adaptation are paramount. Criticisms of Periodization Model One of the primary criticisms of traditional periodization models, particularly linear periodization, centers on their perceived rigidity and the assumption of predictable, linear improvements in athlete performance. Critics argue that these models may not adequately accommodate the individual variability in athletes' responses to training or the unpredictable nature of external factors, such as competition schedules and life stresses. Kiely (2012) has been vocal in highlighting the limitations of traditional periodization, pointing out that the human organism's adaptation to stress is highly complex and non-linear, suggesting that periodization models need to be more flexible and responsive to the athlete's ongoing needs and circumstances. Further, the effectiveness of periodization has been questioned in the context of non-elite athletes. The structured nature of periodized plans is often seen as overly complex for recreational athletes, whose training goals might not require such meticulous planning. This has led to discussions about the applicability and scalability of periodization principles across different levels of athletic participation, with some suggesting a need for simplified or more adaptable models for non-elite populations. Research Gaps and Future Directions Despite the extensive application of periodization in sports training, significant research gaps remain, particularly regarding the comparative effectiveness of different periodization models across various sports, genders, age groups, and levels of athletic ability. The majority of research has focused on elite athletes in specific sports, leaving a gap in understanding about how periodization principles might be best applied to recreational athletes, youth, and elderly populations. Moreover, there is a call for more interdisciplinary research that considers the psychological and social factors influencing training adaptation, moving beyond purely physiological outcomes. Future directions in periodization research and practice are likely to emphasize greater individualization and flexibility. Advances in technology and data analytics offer promising avenues for developing more personalized training programs that can dynamically adjust to real-time feedback on an athlete's performance, recovery state, and overall well-being. The integration of wearable technology, biometric monitoring, and machine learning algorithms could revolutionize the way training loads are prescribed and adjusted, making periodization a more precise and adaptive tool for optimizing athletic performance. Additionally, there is an increasing interest in exploring the psychological aspects of periodization, including the impact of training variation on motivation, mental fatigue, and athlete engagement. Understanding the interplay between physical and psychological factors in training adaptation could lead to more holistic periodization strategies that not only aim to optimize physical performance but also enhance mental resilience and athlete satisfaction. In conclusion, while periodization remains a cornerstone of sports training methodology, it is not without its criticisms and challenges. The ongoing debates and research efforts highlight the field's complexity and the continuous need for innovation and adaptation. By addressing the identified gaps and exploring new directions, periodization can evolve to meet the diverse needs of athletes across the spectrum of sport in general, HYROX specifically and physical activity, reinforcing its relevance and efficacy in the dynamic landscape of sports science. Given the complexity of this topic, we’ll explore it further in the HYROX365 Academy Course Level 2 \"Mastering Performance.\" I look forward to seeing you there, whether in one of our self-paced online courses or Masterclasses."

This chapter outlines the steps involved in designing a periodized training program, supported by literature and examples to illustrate best practices in sports science. Chapter: Sport Specific Needs Analysis The first step in designing a periodized training program is conducting a comprehensive needs analysis. This analysis involves evaluating the sport's physiological, biomechanical, and psychological demands, as well as the athlete's current performance level and potential areas for improvement. Stone, Stone, and Sands (2007) emphasize the importance of this step, stating, \"A thorough needs analysis is critical for identifying the key performance determinants in the sport and the athlete's relative strengths and weaknesses.\" Example: For a long-distance runner, the needs analysis might reveal a requirement for improved aerobic capacity, muscular endurance, and mental resilience, guiding the focus of the periodized training program. HYROX events are designed to test a wide range of fitness domains, including strength, endurance, speed, and agility, through a series of standardized workouts coupled with running. Chapter: Knowing your Athlete Periodization in training programs needs to be tailored not only to the specific demands of the sport but also to the unique physiological and psychological needs of different age groups: youth, adults, and the elderly. Each group presents its own challenges and opportunities for athletic development, making it essential to craft a periodized training plan that meets these specific requirements. But it’s also important to consider gender differences in training. Coaching women involves a different approach, both physically and mentally. This means being mindful of the unique needs of female athletes, ensuring that their training is not only effective but also supportive of their overall well-being. Chapter: Setting Goals and Objectives Based on the needs analysis and the profile of our athlete, specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) goals and objectives are established. These goals provide a clear direction for the training program and enable the monitoring of progress. Bompa and Buzzichelli (2015) advocate for goal setting as a fundamental component, noting, \"Setting clear, achievable goals is essential for motivating the athlete and guiding the design of the training program.\" When designing a training program, the time component is probably the most important and challenging aspect for every coach. Athletes often approach coaches with the expectation of becoming fit and \"race ready\" for new personal bests in weeks rather than months. However, it's crucial to recognize that developing physical qualities like strength, power, or endurance requires time. This makes it essential to start with the macrocycles, focusing on overarching goals such as redeveloping strength or building aerobic endurance capacity. By prioritizing these foundational elements early on, coaches can better manage the time constraints while still guiding athletes toward their peak performance. Chapter: Determining Volume, Intensity, and Frequency The next step is to carefully tailor the volume, intensity, and frequency of training to the athlete’s specific goals, current fitness level, age, and training experience, as well as the phase of periodization they are in. Properly adjusting these elements is essential for promoting the desired adaptations while also preventing the risk of overtraining. Chapter: Integration of Training Components By now you know that a periodized training program for HYROX should seamlessly integrate various training components—such as strength, endurance, flexibility, and technique—into the overall plan. This holistic approach ensures that all physical qualities relevant to HYROX events and the athlete's performance goals are developed in a balanced manner. As Fleck (2011) emphasizes, \"Integrating diverse training components within a periodized plan promotes comprehensive athlete development and prevents imbalances.\" For instance, a HYROX athlete’s training regimen should include strength training specifically aimed at enhancing muscular endurance and functional strength for exercises like sled pushes, wall balls, or wall ball. Endurance training should focus on improving both aerobic and anaerobic capacity to sustain the high-intensity efforts required during running segments and other demanding activities. Flexibility exercises are essential for increasing range of motion and minimizing the risk of injury during the varied movements involved in HYROX events. Moreover, technique drills are crucial for refining the athlete’s efficiency in both lifting and carrying tasks, as well as running. By incorporating these elements, the training program will effectively address the multifaceted demands of HYROX competitions, leading to optimized performance and reduced risk of injury. Chapter: Consider Recovery Times When designing training programs for athletes, everything seems straightforward while we're at the computer planning mesocycles and training sessions. As a new coach, it's tempting to try and include all elements of a good HYROX training program in just one week! Naturally, clients and athletes are eager to get fit quickly and often wish for rapid results and outstanding performance in their next HYROX race. Just as the right volume and intensity paired with the right training exercises are important, rest and recovery are also crucial components of any effective training program. Proper recovery allows muscles to repair and strengthen, prevents overtraining, and enhances overall performance. This principle is incorporated into their nonlinear periodization model, which includes strategically planned rest periods to optimize training adaptations and long-term fitness gains. Remember: Recovery times for different energy systems vary based on the nature of the energy system and the intensity of the activity! These recovery periods are essential for optimizing performance and preventing injury."

So, let’s start with supercompensation! Supercompensation is a fundamental concept in sports science and training theory that describes the process by which the body adapts to a training stimulus, leading to improved performance. The concept is rooted in the body's natural ability to recover from stress and to adapt in such a way that it becomes stronger or more capable than it was before the stress was applied. Chapter: Supercompensation So let's break down the process of how our buddies respond to training. First up, we've got the initial stimulus, or what we might call the training load. This is when you're hitting the gym, running, or engaging in any kind of exercise. Essentially, you're placing stress on your body, which temporarily reduces your performance. You're depleting energy, breaking down muscle fibers, and really taxing your system. Next is the recovery phase. After you workout, your body starts to bounce back. It's in this period that muscle fibers get repaired, energy stores like glycogen are replenished, and your body restores itself to its normal state. If you're giving yourself enough recovery time, your body doesn't just get back to where it was, it actually prepares for the future by adapting to the stress you've put it through. Then we move into the super compensation phase. The super compensation phase is the sweet spot. Here, your body adapts to the Chinese stimulus by becoming stronger, faster or more efficient than ever before. It's like your body is overcompensating for the stress it endured, leading to improvements in things like muscle size, strength and endurance. But here's the kicker, the detraining phase, also known as the involution phase. If you stop training after hitting that super compensation high, your body will slowly drift back to its baseline performance level. Those gains you made, they're not permanent unless you keep reinforcing them with regular training. Chapter: … but it is not that easy The supercompensation model, while widely recognized and used as a foundation for training programs, has received criticism for its oversimplification of the complex processes involved in athletic training and adaptation. Here are some of the main critiques: Oversimplification of Biological Processes The supercompensation model assumes a straightforward, linear relationship between training stimulus, recovery, and performance improvement. Critics argue that the body's adaptation processes are far more complex, involving numerous variables such as hormone levels, individual genetics, nutritional status, and mental state. The model does not fully account for these factors, leading to a potentially misleading understanding of how adaptation actually occurs. Lack of Individualization The model suggests a one-size-fits-all approach to training and recovery, which does not account for individual differences. Each athlete may respond differently to the same training stimulus, with variations in the length of recovery time needed, the intensity of supercompensation, and the risk of overtraining. The model's generalization may not be applicable to all athletes or training contexts. Ignores Psychological Factors The supercompensation model focuses primarily on the physiological aspects of training and recovery, neglecting the significant role of psychological factors. Mental stress, motivation, and psychological recovery are crucial elements that impact an athlete's overall adaptation and performance, but they are not considered in the traditional supercompensation framework. Risk of Overtraining By emphasizing the importance of timing training sessions to coincide with the peak of supercompensation, the model may inadvertently encourage athletes to push through fatigue, leading to a higher risk of overtraining. This focus on precise timing can be challenging to manage in practice, especially when individual recovery times can vary significantly from session to session. Limited Application to Different Training Modalities The model was originally developed with endurance sports in mind and may not be as applicable to other forms of training, such as strength training, skill acquisition, or team sports. Different types of exercise induce different kinds of stress on the body with different recovery times, and the supercompensation model may not adequately represent these varied demands. Chapter: Recovery and Super-Compensation Here’s how the critiques of the supercompensation model apply to a HYROX athlete, with a focus on the different recovery durations for various physiological processes. --> 00:00:08.960 Okay, coaches, --> 00:00:09.680 let's dive --> 00:00:12.040 now into the complexities of recovery --> 00:00:14.480 for a HYROX athlete, particularly --> 00:00:15.640 when we consider --> 00:00:16.960 that the different --> 00:00:19.560 physiological processes at play. --> 00:00:21.160 The super compensation model --> 00:00:22.400 is a widely used --> 00:00:24.000 framework in sports training, --> 00:00:26.360 suggesting that after a workout, --> 00:00:27.560 the body recovers --> 00:00:28.800 and even enhances --> 00:00:30.880 its performance potential. --> 00:00:33.720 However, this model oversimplifies --> 00:00:35.720 the reality of how our bodies --> 00:00:36.920 truly adapt. --> 00:00:39.240 I would like to give you some examples --> 00:00:40.840 that illustrate this. --> 00:00:41.600 For example, --> 00:00:43.680 after a typical HYROX workout --> 00:00:44.720 that includes heavy --> 00:00:46.720 sled pushes, running and rowing, --> 00:00:49.000 the model might suggest that the athlete --> 00:00:49.840 will be ready --> 00:00:52.000 for another high intensity session --> 00:00:53.600 in just a couple of days. --> 00:00:56.440 But the truth is far more nuanced. --> 00:00:58.720 While glycogen stores in the muscles --> 00:01:01.800 might replenish within 24 to 48 hours --> 00:01:03.080 with proper nutrition, --> 00:01:04.240 and ATP levels --> 00:01:05.960 might bounce back within minutes --> 00:01:07.040 to hours. --> 00:01:08.440 The nervous system, --> 00:01:09.600 which is heavily text --> 00:01:10.600 during these strength --> 00:01:12.000 endurance exercises, --> 00:01:15.000 could take several days to fully recover. --> 00:01:17.960 Meanwhile, protein synthesis --> 00:01:19.880 is crucial for repairing those hard --> 00:01:20.960 working muscles. --> 00:01:24.000 Might also take 24 to 48 hours. --> 00:01:25.440 But if the workout --> 00:01:27.120 was particularly intense, --> 00:01:30.080 this process could take even longer. --> 00:01:31.200 The super compensation --> 00:01:32.640 model doesn't fully account --> 00:01:33.800 for these varying --> 00:01:35.120 recovery timelines, --> 00:01:37.760 which can lead to an incomplete recovery --> 00:01:40.520 if athletes follow it too rigidly. --> 00:01:42.880 This is where individualization --> 00:01:44.160 becomes crucial. --> 00:01:45.440 Consider two HYROX --> 00:01:47.840 athletes completing the same intense --> 00:01:49.000 training session. --> 00:01:49.960 One athlete --> 00:01:51.200 with a higher baseline --> 00:01:52.760 fitness level and efficient --> 00:01:54.200 recovery practices --> 00:01:55.040 might restore --> 00:01:58.120 their glycogen and ATP levels quicker. --> 00:01:59.640 Then, the nervous system --> 00:02:02.360 might be ready with one day or two. --> 00:02:04.160 However, another athlete --> 00:02:06.320 who might be newer to the sport --> 00:02:06.960 has less --> 00:02:08.720 effective recovery habits, --> 00:02:10.160 could need more time, --> 00:02:11.840 particularly for protein --> 00:02:14.080 synthesis and nervous system recovery. --> 00:02:16.480 Yet the model would suggest --> 00:02:17.880 similar recovery times --> 00:02:19.200 for both, potentially --> 00:02:20.920 leading less recovered --> 00:02:22.280 athletes to train again --> 00:02:24.960 before they are truly ready. --> 00:02:25.640 But while --> 00:02:27.320 their glycogen and ATP --> 00:02:29.240 levels might be restored, --> 00:02:30.320 the nervous system, --> 00:02:31.480 which was heavily text --> 00:02:33.120 during the previous session, --> 00:02:35.360 might still be fatigued. --> 00:02:36.280 The muscle repair --> 00:02:38.040 from protein synthesis --> 00:02:40.120 might also be incomplete. --> 00:02:41.000 Training under --> 00:02:43.920 these conditions can lead to overtraining --> 00:02:46.920 manifesting in chronic fatigue, --> 00:02:49.040 reduced performance, --> 00:02:51.000 and a higher risk of injury. --> 00:02:52.880 Finally, the --> 00:02:54.520 model's application varies --> 00:02:56.640 across different types of training. --> 00:02:57.400 It might work --> 00:02:59.200 well for the running components --> 00:03:00.320 of HYROX training, --> 00:03:01.840 where endurance recovery --> 00:03:04.600 is somewhat predictable. --> 00:03:07.200 However, strength endurance activities --> 00:03:10.320 like sled pause or sled push or strength --> 00:03:10.840 training per --> 00:03:12.600 se involve more complex --> 00:03:14.360 recovery processes. --> 00:03:16.160 The nervous system, for instance, --> 00:03:18.560 might need several days to recover fully. --> 00:03:20.320 Even if glycogen stores --> 00:03:21.680 are quickly replenished --> 00:03:24.000 with right nutrition. --> 00:03:26.480 All this complexity isn't fully captured --> 00:03:28.120 in the super compensation model, --> 00:03:29.880 which can make it less effective --> 00:03:32.120 for planning a balanced training program --> 00:03:33.040 that integrates --> 00:03:36.160 both endurance and strength endurance. --> 00:03:38.840 So let's face it. --> 00:03:40.200 While the super compensation --> 00:03:41.040 model provides --> 00:03:42.640 a useful framework, --> 00:03:43.280 it's essential --> 00:03:45.800 to recognize its limitations. --> 00:03:47.120 Recovery times vary --> 00:03:48.920 significantly depending --> 00:03:51.320 on the physiological system involved. --> 00:03:52.400 Whether it's glycogen --> 00:03:54.440 replenishment, ATP restoration, --> 00:03:55.960 protein synthesis, --> 00:03:58.280 or the nervous system recovery. --> 00:04:00.320 For a HYROX coach, understanding --> 00:04:01.840 these nuances is key --> 00:04:04.680 to optimizing performance and avoiding --> 00:04:06.440 the pitfalls of overtraining."

The Pareto Principle, also known as the 80/20 principle, states that 80% of results come from 20% of causes. In the context of sports, this means that focusing on a few, but crucial, training elements can prove particularly effective. For example, a runner might find that 80% of his performance improvement comes from just 20% of his training sessions - the intense, quality sessions where even the smallest segments of the movement process are focused on. From these specific units, optimizations of the movement can be derived, whose application and implementation can increase performance efficiency in all other training units many times over. This can be applied across all sports. The Compound Effect, on the other hand, refers to the cumulative effect of small, but consistent actions or changes over a long period. In sports, this is particularly relevant as small, but consistent improvements in training, nutrition, or recovery can lead to significant performance gains over time. Thus, every athlete can evoke an incredible performance increase through small changes over the consistency of one or several years. The immense strength of the Compound Effect becomes particularly visible in this monetary example, but can be applied to all other areas of life. The example is as follows: Would you rather receive 3 million euros immediately or 1 cent that doubles every day over the course of 31 days? The answer seems simple, however, the calculation results in the 1 cent increasing over the steady doubling for a month. At the end of the period an immense sum of 10.7 million euros is compounded. This overshadows the immediately available 3 million euros and once again clarifies the effects that small changes can have over time. Taken together, the Pareto Principle and the Compound Effect can provide a framework for developing habits in and outside of sports that are both stable and enduring. It's about focusing on crucial behavior changes (Pareto Principle) and consistently and long-term pursuing them (Compound Effect). Dopamine-driven feedback loops In addition to these two principles, the body's intrinsic biochemical processes can be leveraged to reinforce such habits and sustain the motivation necessary for their continuation. In this context, the neurotransmitter dopamine, which plays a critical role in all aspects of human action planning and execution, is of particular significance. The process takes place in so-called dopaminergic feedback loops. These are crucial for the regulation of behavior, motivation, and learning processes. These mechanisms help to form habits, maintain rewarding behaviors, and support learning processes. However, they can also play a role in certain addictive behaviors or compulsive behaviors, as excessive stimulation of the dopaminergic system can lead to uncontrollable desire and compulsive behavior. A current and quite acute example of this is social media addiction, which is conditioned by the excessive dopamine release while watching video contributions on social media. Dopamine-driven feedback loops are neurological mechanisms based on the neurotransmitter dopamine and play a central role in regulating reward, motivation, learning, and other important processes in the brain. These mechanisms enable us to reinforce or modulate behavior by using dopamine as a signaling substance. This cyclic process, in which dopamine is released in response to certain actions or events, contributes to reinforcing or repeating these actions. Two main components of these dopaminergic feedback loops are reward and reinforcement as well as learning and motivation. When an action or behavior leads to a positive outcome or reward, dopamine is released in the brain. This increase in dopamine production reinforces the behavior that led to the reward and motivates the brain to repeat similar actions in the future to receive more rewards. This reward and reinforcement cycle contributes to habit formation and motivation. In sports, such a reward can be triggered either self-initiated by an improved time in a competitive discipline, or by something seemingly simple like a good muscle feeling during a certain exercise. Rewards, whether oral or tactile, can trigger a release of dopamine in the athlete, which subsequently enhances the athlete’s perception of the training process. This dopamine response leads to increased satisfaction and motivation during training, ultimately contributing to improved performance and client satisfaction over the long term. Furthermore, dopamine plays a crucial role in the learning process by helping to establish connections between actions and rewards. When the brain learns that certain actions lead to pleasant results, dopamine is released to reinforce these connections and increase the motivation to continue performing these actions. Thus, particularly the smaller changes in movement efficiency learned in technique training, through their effect on overall performance and the satisfaction associated with one's own performance, can strengthen the learning process. The cause of this is once again the increased dopamine release. Dopaminergic feedback loops are thus critically important for the regulation of behavior, motivation, and learning processes, as they contribute to the formation of habits, the maintenance of rewarding behaviors, and the facilitation of learning. Recent research indicates that these mechanisms can also be implicated in certain addictive or compulsive behaviors, as excessive stimulation of the dopaminergic system can lead to uncontrollable cravings and compulsive actions. Consequently, a thorough understanding and effective utilization of dopaminergic feedback loops is essential in the context of coaching. In summary, for the development of long-lasting habits, a high degree of patience and endurance is required. Understanding the preceding principles and how they can be reinforced through the body's own reward processes can facilitate and make the creation of healthy habits more effective. By focusing on the few, but crucial behavior changes and the constant effort for consistency, habits can be created that not only have positive effects on our athletic performance, but also give us the knowledge to achieve constant progress in all areas of life."

    "content": "Titel: Level 1 - Module 8 - Resilience: Handling Fear and Injuries URL: https://web.lemon-mobile-learning.com/hyrox/#/inhalt/17973 Chapter: Resilience: Handling Fear and Injuries Whether in athletics, working life, or regular daily life, people are constantly confronted with situations that require mental resilience. It influences many different areas of life and can significantly increase self-perception and thus optimize overall quality of life by improving how we deal with stressors from the environment. In the following section, we will give you an overview of what exactly is meant by resilience and how it can be built up and maintained on one's own using a specific model. We will then apply this to the constructs of performance pressure and stage fright, which are particularly common in athletic disciplines. Finally, we will use the importance of mental resilience to lay the foundation for efficient injury management. This way, you can help your athletes come back from injury periods stronger and with renewed motivation, without falling into a downward spiral. Resilience itself denotes the ability to remain resilient and adaptive in crisis situations and act accordingly. To illustrate the construct, we use the model of the 7 pillars of resilience according to Ursula Nuber. She subdivides these pillars into 4 basic attitudes and 3 applicable practices: 1. Acceptance The first pillar is acceptance. It refers to the necessity of accepting unchangeable situations and circumstances in order to be able to act stress-free. In addition to accepting situational factors, this also includes self-acceptance, including all perceived mistakes and flaws. Because only the acceptance of oneself in the current state, as well as the situation, can reduce cognitive dissonance and help us cope with any situation, whether performance or everyday challenges. 2. Attachment The second pillar is attachment. It refers to the relationship with oneself and with others, to groups or systems. Strong bonds fulfill the human need for contact and strengthen social support. This can occur in both the professional and private sectors. In relation to the athletic area of coaching, it can be said that both the sports group or team itself, as well as the individual coach as a reference person, can strengthen the resilience of his clients. Therefore, in addition to the professional bond, it is also necessary to build a sufficiently emotional bond with your coachees. 3. Solution orientation The solution orientation, the third pillar, is particularly important in weaker periods. It encourages setting positive, specific, and realistic goals. The focus here is on achieving the goals in smaller stages to activate the positive feedback spiral discussed earlier. Your coaching participants can achieve this, among other things, through the perception that their own independent actions have led to the achievement of the previously set goals. For this, feel free to use our Hyrox Goal Setting Planner Sheet. 4. Healthy optimism The fourth pillar refers to a healthy optimism. This distinguishes itself from blind optimism in that it realistically considers both positive and negative aspects. Basically, it's about moderating between negative and positive focus in order to be able to draw something positive from problematic situations. This approach helps to reduce stress without underestimating the situation. 5. Self-perception The fifth pillar, self-perception, is the first step towards a healthy relationship with oneself. It enables one to perceive and correctly classify the signals of one's own body. This is about the attentive perception of the signals presented by our own body. These can be emotions, perceived stress or even physical strains such as pain in certain movements. Such a perception filter enables improved perception of our system and can help give engaging action impulses. 6. Self-reflection The sixth pillar is self-reflection. It enables one to view oneself from a meta-perspective and to reflect on one's own reactions, thoughts and feeling patterns. This can lead to improved action execution in already experienced situations. The common reflection technique of journaling is suitable for this. In this, specific questions are answered in writing as extensively as possible. The questions to be answered can be freely chosen, but should ideally focus on the situation to be managed. 7. Self-efficacy The seventh and last pillar is self-efficacy. It is based on the belief that one's own actions have effects and that one is capable of actively bringing about improvements. In order to effectively train this, so-called anchors can be helpful. These are memory aids that help everyone to keep in mind their own resources and abilities in difficult situations. These anchors can be physical (a picture, a list, a diary, a lucky charm) or psychological (memories, thoughts) in nature. In addition to the competition preparation itself, mental resilience can also have a strong positive influence on the perceived stage fright or the perceived performance pressure. Stage fright itself is defined as the general physical and psychological tension before an upcoming task. Here, a distinction is made between positive and negative stage fright. In its negative form, it manifests as strong nervousness, fear, or various stress reactions induced by increased cortisol secretion. The most common symptoms here are palpitations, trembling, and irritability, but it can also manifest itself through migraines to fever. In contrast, the positive variant of stage fright can have a performance-enhancing effect as perceived eustress. The basis for this is that the body is put into an increased state of arousal by the expectation of a challenging task, which can be energetically used with correct handling. For such energetically efficient use of the state caused by the tension, an athlete must be able to recognize the signs early, absorb them, and use them self-effectively. Therefore, a pronounced mental resilience is again the basis. Because only if the foundation is sufficiently present through the expression of the various pillars, an athlete can make use of the positive effects of the increased state of arousal. It is therefore of enormous importance to have internalized the basics of strengthening this mental resilience and to include it into the training concept as a sports psychological component, in order not only to increase the performance of the athletes but also to positively influence your own reputation through the holistic consideration of the clients in the long term. Last but not least, mental resilience plays a significant role in dealing with sports injuries. Studies have shown that sports psychological interventions in combination with conventional physiotherapeutic treatment lead to a significant improvement in the rehabilitation process (Alfermann & Stoll, 2010). Accordingly, it is of immense importance to at least have the knowledge to be able to act in case of a possible injury of your coachees. Within the strengthening of the seven pillars of resilience, the areas of acceptance, solution orientation, and self-efficacy have crystallized as efficient measures. If such an injury situation occurs, you can actively assist to facilitate the re-entry of your athletes. In addition, there are several other techniques that are beneficial for dealing with sports injuries, which are more related to the physical healing process itself. An example to mention is the imagination of the healing process, in which the injured person mentally visualizes the healing process in all sub-areas. Such a visualization technique can restore the connection between muscle tissue and brain and generate a faster return to training. In general, however, it is particularly important to support the mental stability of the athletes first, as they can often fall into a downward spiral due to the lack of the usual rhythm when injured. This can lead to depression, anger, and rage or low self-esteem. This must be prevented. Therefore, you should make use of the knowledge about mental resilience in order to best support your clients in case of an injury. In conclusion, it can be stated that mental resilience is an extremely important construct, which in turn has a wide-ranging impact on the perception and handling of complex life situations. Therefore, it is important to have internalized the basics of strengthening this resilience and to incorporate it as a sports psychological component into the training concept, not only to increase the performance of the athletes but also to positively influence one's reputation in the long term through a holistic view of the clients."

While technical knowledge and physical training plans are critical, the effectiveness of a coach often hinges on their soft skills. Soft skills, such as communication, empathy, adaptability, leadership, teamwork, problem-solving, time management, conflict resolution, work ethic, and creativity, are essential in creating a supportive, motivating, and productive training environment. This document will explore how these soft skills can be integrated into training to enhance athlete performance and well-being. Communication involves the ability to convey information clearly and effectively. In HYROX coaching, communication is crucial for providing clear instructions, offering feedback, and motivating athletes. Clear instructions ensure that athletes understand how to perform exercises correctly, which helps prevent injuries and ensures efficient training. Providing constructive feedback is also essential, as it helps athletes understand their strengths and areas for improvement. Additionally, communication is vital for motivation. Coaches can use positive reinforcement and encouragement to keep athletes motivated, celebrating achievements and reminding them of their progress. Empathy, the ability to understand and share the feelings of others, plays a significant role in coaching. Empathy helps build trust between the coach and the athlete, making athletes more likely to open up about their challenges and concerns. It also provides emotional support, which is crucial given the physical and emotional demands of training. Coaches should actively listen to athletes, showing that they value their perspectives and acknowledging their feelings and concerns. Showing compassion is also important. Coaches need to be mindful of the physical and emotional strains of training and offer encouragement and support during difficult times. Furthermore, empathy involves adjusting training plans based on the athlete’s current emotional and physical state. If an athlete is feeling particularly stressed or fatigued, the coach might modify the session to ensure the athlete does not overstrain themselves. Adaptability, the ability to adjust to new conditions and changes, is another essential soft skill in HYROX coaching. Each athlete is unique, with different strengths, weaknesses, and needs. Adaptable coaches can tailor training programs to fit these individual differences. Adaptability also involves responding to changes, such as unexpected weather conditions, injuries, or scheduling conflicts. Embracing new methods is another aspect of adaptability. Coaches should stay updated with the latest training and competition techniques and be open to integrating new methods into their coaching. Leadership is the ability to guide, motivate, and manage a team. Effective leadership in HYROX coaching involves setting clear goals, leading by example, and motivating athletes. Coaches should define clear, achievable goals for their athletes and ensure they understand the objectives and the steps needed to reach them. Leading by example is also crucial. Coaches should demonstrate the behaviors and attitudes they expect from their athletes, showing commitment, discipline, and enthusiasm. Additionally, motivating and inspiring athletes is an essential part of leadership. Coaches can use motivational techniques to inspire their athletes, sharing success stories, offering words of encouragement, and recognizing their their hard work and achievements. Chapter: Teamwork Teamwork, which involves working well with others towards a common goal, is vital in training. Teamwork promotes cohesion and mutual support among athletes, which is essential for team-based events and overall morale. Coaches should encourage collaboration by designing training activities that require athletes to work together. Promoting a team culture is also important. Coaches should create an environment where athletes feel like part of a team, encouraging them to celebrate each other’s successes and provide support during challenges. Facilitating communication among team members is another aspect of teamwork. Coaches should encourage open communication and address any conflicts or misunderstandings promptly to maintain harmony. Problem-solving, the ability to find solutions to challenges or issues, is another crucial soft skill in HYROX coaching. Problem-solving helps athletes navigate and overcome various challenges they may face during training and competitions. Coaches should be proactive in identifying potential problems, whether they are related to training routines, athlete performance, or interpersonal conflicts. Developing solutions collaboratively with athletes is also important. Coaches should encourage athletes to contribute ideas and be part of the solution process. Implementing solutions and monitoring their effectiveness is another aspect of problem-solving. Coaches should be willing to adjust and try different approaches if the initial solution doesn’t work. Chapter: Conflict resolution Conflict resolution, the ability to mediate and resolve disagreements effectively, is another vital soft skill in HYROX coaching. Conflict resolution helps maintain a positive and cooperative training environment by resolving conflicts promptly. Coaches should address conflicts as soon as they arise to prevent them from escalating. Encouraging open communication and ensuring that all parties feel heard and understood is also important. Promoting a culture of respect and understanding within the team is another aspect of conflict resolution. Coaches should model respectful behavior and encourage athletes to do the same. Work ethic, which involves demonstrating a strong commitment to work, reliability, and professionalism, is crucial in training. Coaches should exemplify a strong work ethic to inspire their athletes to do the same. This includes arriving on time, preparing thoroughly for each session, and showing dedication to athletes’ progress and well-being. Coaches should also expect the same level of commitment from their athletes, holding them accountable for their attendance, effort, and attitude. Consistency is key to progress, and both coaches and athletes should strive to give their best effort at every session. Creativity, the ability to think outside the box and come up with innovative solutions, is an essential soft skill in HYROX coaching. Creativity helps keep training interesting and engaging for athletes, which can boost motivation and prevent burnout. Coaches should introduce new exercises and training methods regularly to keep workouts fresh and challenging. Encouraging athletes to set creative goals and challenges for themselves is also important. Additionally, creativity can help coaches find innovative solutions to training obstacles. Incorporating these soft skills into coaching can significantly enhance the effectiveness of training programs, build stronger relationships between coaches and athletes, and improve overall athlete performance and satisfaction. By focusing on communication, empathy, adaptability, leadership, teamwork, problem-solving, time management, conflict resolution, work ethic, and creativity, coaches can create a supportive and motivating environment that fosters continuous improvement and long-term success."

Understanding the signs of burnout and how to prevent it is critical for maintaining long-term success in this field. The following text will provide you with an understanding of burnout symptoms, the importance of early detection, and effective preventative measures in the context of sports coaching. Burnout is a serious syndrome characterized by excessive stress, emotional and physical exhaustion, and the feeling of being unable to cope with one's own professional demands. This is particularly relevant for coaches in the sports field, who are often exposed to constant stress and pressure to succeed in their work. The symptoms of burnout can be diverse and develop gradually. They range from emotional exhaustion and depersonalization to physical symptoms and social isolation. Therefore, constant lack of energy and cynicism, as well as severe headaches, gastrointestinal problems, or sleep disorders can be signs of a work overload. It is especially important for sports coaches to recognize these signs early on, as their work performance and wellbeing directly affect the quality of their coaching performance. In addition, it is of enormous importance for the ongoing professional career to recognize these signs before it's too late, as a complete burnout can lead to further comorbidities (subsequent diseases). For example, clinical depression or serious psychosomatic diseases that could develop from burnout. It is imperative to prevent this at all costs.As assistance for the early detection of burnout symptoms, sports coaches can pay attention to various aspects of their personal and professional situation. These include changes in their own behavior, their own emotions, and physical wellbeing. Their own attitude towards work and social behavior should also be observed. Conscious reflection of these areas can help to recognize warning signs early and to react appropriately. We recommend an active reflection session per week. This does not necessarily have to last longer than 20 minutes, as any form of active reflection work illuminates the experienced from a meta-level and thus even a short duration can provide profound insights. It is advisable to go to a quiet place similar to a meditation session and systematically reflect on the described thematic fields. Writing down the results can also help to sort thoughts and enables a permanent availability of the results. In addition to detection, it is also important to take preventive measures and find solutions proactively. These include self-care in the form of a healthy diet and sufficient sleep, as well as relaxation techniques. Also, creating balances through hobbies outside of work is another recommended aspect. In acute cases, a professional change, social exchange in the form of self-help groups, or professional therapeutic help can also be used. Through these measures, sports coaches can reduce their risk of burnout and maintain their mental health and work performance to be successful in the long term. In summary, it is crucial for sports coaches to recognize signs of overload early, take preventive measures, and seek support if needed. Through conscious self-care and a proactive approach to the challenges of coaching, they can protect their health and work performance and keep their coaching quality at a high level to not only bring themselves but also their clients to peak performance."

It is of enormous importance that these coaching goals are clearly defined. It can also be helpful to write them down and further break them down into smaller milestones. This allows athletes to trigger their own reward system by checking off these goals, which in turn evokes a feeling of pride in their own performance. This kind of intermittent reward before achieving the overall goal can keep the motivation of the athletes constant throughout the entire coaching process, which in turn increases the probability of coaching success. In addition to overall success, the achievement of the athletes' goals also results in higher clients satisfaction. This, in turn, promotes the trainer's reputation or even leads to repeat clients, which is desirable from an economic point of view for every HYROX coach. For this first step towards optimal understanding of your athletes, we are providing you with a PDF template of a goal-setting sheet in the following. You are welcome to use this in printed form or digitally to create a clearly defined picture of your clients' goals and create a motivational anchor point to which your athletes can always return with you to analyze and reward their accomplished performance. How to use the planner (Download in the unit) Print out our HYROX Goalsetting Planner as often as you need. This corresponds to the number of participants in your coaching. Then fill out the respective boxes with your coachees. In the first step, you define 1-3 general goals. A total timeline is set for this. Then you can jointly define milestone goals, which contribute to the overall goal. Next to this is an area for notes or further personal remarks. In a final step, individual tasks are then defined, which need to be systematically tackled to achieve the milestone goals. This sheet helps you to know your athletes' goals precisely, as well as helping them to become aware of these goals themselves. Furthermore, the joint elaboration enhances your relationship with each other and enables you to design a more specific training. You could either let your customers leave their goal sheet at your training facility, so they can rewatch their goals before every training session or they could take it home to really internalize their goals themselves."

I will guide you through --> 00:00:17.640 a quick definition --> 00:00:18.880 on what learning is. --> 00:00:19.960 Then we will head over --> 00:00:20.680 into the three --> 00:00:21.840 learning mechanics --> 00:00:23.160 that we will cover today. --> 00:00:24.120 And after that, --> 00:00:25.080 I will give you --> 00:00:26.280 a quick explanation --> 00:00:28.160 and of course an implementation --> 00:00:30.000 on how you can implement --> 00:00:31.520 certain strategies --> 00:00:32.320 in your actual --> 00:00:34.440 training practice. --> 00:00:36.360 So learning itself is defined --> 00:00:37.200 by the Oxford --> 00:00:37.800 Dictionary --> 00:00:40.000 as the acquisition of knowledge --> 00:00:41.400 or skills through either --> 00:00:43.040 studying, experience --> 00:00:44.640 or through being taught --> 00:00:46.440 and learning describes --> 00:00:47.160 the structured --> 00:00:49.000 processing of information --> 00:00:49.520 in order --> 00:00:51.200 to accumulate knowledge. --> 00:00:52.080 And this structural --> 00:00:53.440 processing of information --> 00:00:54.640 from the environment --> 00:00:56.120 plays a very important role --> 00:00:57.320 for us as humans --> 00:00:59.920 in order to develop heuristics. --> 00:01:00.840 So heuristics --> 00:01:02.680 are basically automated --> 00:01:03.920 behavior responses --> 00:01:06.720 or automated behavior patterns --> 00:01:09.120 that our brain uses --> 00:01:10.680 in order to save more energy, --> 00:01:11.400 because it doesn't --> 00:01:12.560 have to memorize --> 00:01:13.800 every single interaction --> 00:01:14.560 that we have --> 00:01:15.760 with certain information --> 00:01:17.000 from the environment. --> 00:01:18.120 So this basically means --> 00:01:19.480 that our brain develops --> 00:01:20.600 certain behavior --> 00:01:21.600 patterns of behavior, --> 00:01:22.600 responses --> 00:01:24.120 to certain situations --> 00:01:25.560 that we have been in, --> 00:01:26.880 a lot of times. --> 00:01:28.280 And of course, not to forget, --> 00:01:30.360 there are many, many things --> 00:01:31.280 that can influence --> 00:01:32.160 the learning process --> 00:01:33.560 as you might have experienced --> 00:01:34.440 yourself. --> 00:01:36.000 This can be, for example, --> 00:01:37.200 your background, knowledge, --> 00:01:39.120 your current emotional state, --> 00:01:40.200 your abilities, --> 00:01:42.320 your attitudes, your values, --> 00:01:43.880 the culture you grew up in. --> 00:01:44.400 Basically, --> 00:01:45.480 everything can influence --> 00:01:47.280 your learning process. --> 00:01:48.600 So speaking of learning, --> 00:01:50.280 let's look at the three main --> 00:01:51.040 learning mechanics --> 00:01:52.480 that we will cover today. --> 00:01:53.800 Those three learning mechanics --> 00:01:55.400 will be the auditory --> 00:01:57.240 learning, the visual learning --> 00:01:59.040 and the kinesthetic learning. --> 00:01:59.800 Starting off --> 00:02:01.200 with the auditory learning. --> 00:02:02.920 As you might already suggest. --> 00:02:04.480 Auditory learning describes --> 00:02:05.040 the learning --> 00:02:06.160 through auditory channels. --> 00:02:06.760 So for us --> 00:02:08.640 it will be the hearing channel. --> 00:02:10.680 And there are certain people --> 00:02:11.280 that will --> 00:02:12.440 characterize themselves --> 00:02:13.720 as auditory learners. --> 00:02:15.760 So they have a preference --> 00:02:17.440 for listening to information --> 00:02:17.920 in order --> 00:02:19.320 to memorize them correctly. --> 00:02:21.160 So they learn most efficiently --> 00:02:22.440 when they hear --> 00:02:23.640 certain information. --> 00:02:25.240 For us as HYROX coaches, --> 00:02:26.280 we can satisfy --> 00:02:27.560 this auditory channel --> 00:02:29.040 by verbally explaining --> 00:02:30.000 each step --> 00:02:31.240 of the HYROX routine --> 00:02:32.520 that we are trying to do, --> 00:02:33.840 so that our clients --> 00:02:34.840 that have a preference --> 00:02:36.400 for listening to information --> 00:02:37.600 can remember --> 00:02:38.400 every step --> 00:02:40.040 that we want them to do. --> 00:02:40.600 Then, of course, --> 00:02:41.520 we can make use of --> 00:02:42.640 feedback sessions --> 00:02:43.960 where we will give --> 00:02:45.400 verbal feedback to our clients --> 00:02:46.840 in a one on one setting. --> 00:02:48.000 So we make sure --> 00:02:49.800 that they hear the information --> 00:02:51.200 clearly, that we are trying --> 00:02:52.520 to convey to them. --> 00:02:53.880 And of course, we can make use --> 00:02:54.920 of auditory cues --> 00:02:56.280 for different use cases. --> 00:02:58.080 So basically use --> 00:03:00.040 a verbal or acoustic cue --> 00:03:01.600 like a signal tone --> 00:03:02.680 in order to let's --> 00:03:04.720 say signal and transition --> 00:03:06.000 to a different exercise --> 00:03:06.960 or other important --> 00:03:08.880 moments of the training. --> 00:03:09.840 Then secondly, --> 00:03:11.000 we have the visual --> 00:03:12.240 learning and visual --> 00:03:13.320 learning describes --> 00:03:14.280 the learning through --> 00:03:15.160 optical channels, --> 00:03:16.840 as you might suggest as well. --> 00:03:18.720 And it's the most effective --> 00:03:20.440 for the largest part --> 00:03:21.720 of the human population. --> 00:03:24.200 So most people on this earth --> 00:03:25.080 learn best --> 00:03:26.520 through their visual channel, --> 00:03:27.760 because the eyes are --> 00:03:30.000 what we use to interact --> 00:03:31.880 with our environment mostly, --> 00:03:33.360 and people that are considered --> 00:03:34.680 as visual learners, --> 00:03:36.240 of course, have a preference --> 00:03:37.920 for seeing information, --> 00:03:39.680 but they are also very strong --> 00:03:41.400 in visualizing information --> 00:03:42.640 inside of their brain. --> 00:03:43.560 For us in coaching, --> 00:03:45.120 we can make use of the visual --> 00:03:46.240 learning mechanic --> 00:03:47.320 in different ways. --> 00:03:48.040 For example, --> 00:03:49.640 we can use demonstration videos --> 00:03:51.720 that we either create ourselves --> 00:03:52.520 or use already --> 00:03:54.720 existing demonstration videos --> 00:03:55.840 that show proper form --> 00:03:56.920 and technique. --> 00:03:57.720 And the benefit --> 00:03:59.640 of creating your own videos --> 00:04:00.760 is that you can --> 00:04:02.040 basically create a --> 00:04:03.520 before and after, --> 00:04:04.840 at the start of the training, --> 00:04:06.240 and at the end of the training, --> 00:04:06.840 or once --> 00:04:07.760 the race is finished --> 00:04:08.640 or something. --> 00:04:09.280 Then of course --> 00:04:10.040 we can make use --> 00:04:11.280 of visual information --> 00:04:13.400 in form of charts and diagrams. --> 00:04:14.080 For example, --> 00:04:15.760 we can use a muscle chart --> 00:04:16.240 in order --> 00:04:17.680 to explain --> 00:04:18.720 how different --> 00:04:20.600 muscle groups work together. --> 00:04:22.800 And by that explain --> 00:04:24.040 how an exercise --> 00:04:25.560 is supposed to look --> 00:04:27.400 or we use the diagram --> 00:04:30.000 of how lactate builds up --> 00:04:30.480 in order --> 00:04:31.920 to explain --> 00:04:33.480 how to pace yourself --> 00:04:34.320 over the course --> 00:04:35.680 of a HYROX race. --> 00:04:36.440 And then, of course, --> 00:04:37.200 last but not least, --> 00:04:39.360 we can use visual information --> 00:04:40.920 for our performance tracking. --> 00:04:42.440 So we could implement --> 00:04:43.400 visual performance --> 00:04:44.240 tracking tools --> 00:04:45.840 like different apps --> 00:04:47.520 or even just a --> 00:04:48.880 before and after video, --> 00:04:51.520 to show athletes their --> 00:04:53.120 improvement over time. --> 00:04:53.640 And lastly, --> 00:04:54.280 there is the --> 00:04:55.520 kinesthetic learning. --> 00:04:56.360 So kinesthetic --> 00:04:57.480 learning describes --> 00:04:58.280 the learning --> 00:04:59.440 through your haptic channel. --> 00:05:01.160 So that touch and the feel. --> 00:05:03.160 So the way you interact --> 00:05:04.200 with your environment --> 00:05:05.040 through your hands --> 00:05:06.520 and your feet mostly. --> 00:05:07.080 And people --> 00:05:08.240 that have a preference --> 00:05:09.280 for kinesthetic learning --> 00:05:10.120 really have a --> 00:05:11.480 hands on mentality. --> 00:05:12.800 So they are basically --> 00:05:14.080 the perfect example --> 00:05:15.640 for learning by doing. --> 00:05:17.280 In our HYROX coaching, --> 00:05:18.360 we can satisfy --> 00:05:19.600 the kinesthetic learners --> 00:05:20.920 by simulating --> 00:05:21.360 HYROX --> 00:05:22.560 competition conditions. --> 00:05:24.160 So they practically learn --> 00:05:25.560 the exercises --> 00:05:27.600 whilst being under the pressure --> 00:05:29.320 of the competition conditions --> 00:05:30.360 and therefore --> 00:05:32.760 learn more effectively. --> 00:05:33.600 And then of course, --> 00:05:34.200 we can make use --> 00:05:35.240 of tactile feedback. --> 00:05:37.440 So we actually provide --> 00:05:38.800 physical adjustments --> 00:05:40.600 to the body of our clients --> 00:05:41.640 and guide them --> 00:05:42.360 to help them --> 00:05:43.840 feel the correct form --> 00:05:44.920 and technique --> 00:05:45.720 in order --> 00:05:46.440 to perform --> 00:05:48.160 the exercise correctly. --> 00:05:49.320 So now that we've discussed --> 00:05:50.000 the three main --> 00:05:51.240 learning mechanics, let's jump --> 00:05:52.600 into the explanation. --> 00:05:53.080 Scenario --> 00:05:54.800 one would be introducing --> 00:05:55.920 a new exercise. --> 00:05:56.360 And now, --> 00:05:58.160 in order to satisfy --> 00:05:59.640 every learning mechanic there --> 00:06:02.040 is, we can start by verbally --> 00:06:03.680 explaining the purpose --> 00:06:04.680 and every single --> 00:06:06.000 step of an exercise --> 00:06:07.640 in order to satisfy --> 00:06:09.480 the auditory learners. --> 00:06:10.080 Then, coming --> 00:06:11.160 to the visual learners, --> 00:06:12.840 we need to show either --> 00:06:14.400 a performance video --> 00:06:16.240 or give a live demonstration --> 00:06:17.640 on how the exercise --> 00:06:19.760 is supposed to be like. --> 00:06:20.800 And then last but not least, --> 00:06:22.120 for our kinesthetic learners, --> 00:06:24.000 we need to have the athletes --> 00:06:25.880 practice the exercise --> 00:06:27.520 with our constant guidance, --> 00:06:28.480 so we provide --> 00:06:29.960 constant physical --> 00:06:31.160 feedback to them. --> 00:06:32.320 Scenario two could be --> 00:06:34.200 when you'd like to correct form --> 00:06:35.920 and technique of your athletes. --> 00:06:37.360 And for our auditory learners, --> 00:06:39.000 we need to provide --> 00:06:40.080 verbal instructions --> 00:06:40.840 on the correct --> 00:06:42.960 form of the exercise --> 00:06:44.400 for our visual learners. --> 00:06:45.200 On the other hand, --> 00:06:45.800 we should --> 00:06:46.920 definitely make use --> 00:06:48.040 of video playbacks --> 00:06:49.560 to show the athletes --> 00:06:50.320 their own form. --> 00:06:51.520 So as I just mentioned, --> 00:06:53.640 try to film the athletes --> 00:06:54.440 while performing --> 00:06:55.440 so they can --> 00:06:56.760 see themselves --> 00:06:58.840 how they are performing. --> 00:06:59.520 And lastly, --> 00:07:01.000 for kinesthetic learners, --> 00:07:02.040 we have to have them --> 00:07:04.000 perform the exercise --> 00:07:05.520 and then physically guide --> 00:07:06.920 these athletes --> 00:07:08.160 to the correct position. --> 00:07:09.360 So maybe if they are --> 00:07:10.120 slightly off --> 00:07:11.760 in their in their squat --> 00:07:13.760 or are not touching the ground --> 00:07:14.440 with the knee --> 00:07:16.360 on, on the lunges, --> 00:07:18.360 we should definitely provide --> 00:07:19.840 tactile feedback --> 00:07:20.640 and guide them --> 00:07:22.560 into the correct position. --> 00:07:24.240 Coming to the implementation --> 00:07:25.600 of those learning mechanics --> 00:07:27.000 in our HYROX coaching, --> 00:07:28.400 we should always consider --> 00:07:29.080 keeping a --> 00:07:30.400 comprehensive approach. --> 00:07:32.720 So we need to combine auditory, --> 00:07:35.040 visual and kinesthetic methods --> 00:07:36.280 in our coaching in order --> 00:07:37.800 to constantly address --> 00:07:38.400 all learning --> 00:07:40.480 preferences of our clients. --> 00:07:41.680 And we use this --> 00:07:42.840 by combining --> 00:07:44.680 multimodal training sessions --> 00:07:46.840 with different feedback loops. --> 00:07:47.960 Well guys, that's it --> 00:07:49.280 for this presentation. --> 00:07:50.200 On screen right now --> 00:07:51.640 you have two review questions --> 00:07:52.440 that I would like you --> 00:07:53.160 to answer. --> 00:07:54.600 Just to reflect on the learned --> 00:07:55.680 and maybe brainstorm --> 00:07:57.120 about how you can implement --> 00:07:58.160 those strategies --> 00:07:59.520 in your own coaching. --> 00:08:01.120 And I would like to thank you --> 00:08:01.880 for your attention. --> 00:08:02.760 I hope you enjoyed --> 00:08:03.720 this presentation --> 00:08:05.080 and I will see you guys --> 00:08:06.880 in the next video. Cheers."

Chapter: Communication Models 1 --> 00:00:01.280 Welcome back everyone. --> 00:00:02.480 Today we'll be exploring --> 00:00:03.840 different communication models --> 00:00:05.200 and their application --> 00:00:06.600 in our HYROX coaching. --> 00:00:08.480 Because effective communication --> 00:00:09.440 is the backbone --> 00:00:10.840 of successful coaching --> 00:00:11.880 and understanding --> 00:00:12.600 these models --> 00:00:13.760 will help us to connect --> 00:00:15.120 better with our athletes. --> 00:00:16.600 Therefore, today's presentation --> 00:00:17.160 will cover --> 00:00:18.720 the definition of communication --> 00:00:20.200 as well as different ways --> 00:00:21.600 to communicate. --> 00:00:23.080 And then we'll head over --> 00:00:24.440 to Schulz von Thuns --> 00:00:25.800 communication model --> 00:00:26.960 as well as Paul Watzlawick’s --> 00:00:28.520 communication model --> 00:00:29.920 and their practical application --> 00:00:30.600 of course. --> 00:00:31.680 And then later on --> 00:00:32.560 we'll be looking --> 00:00:34.120 at implementation strategies --> 00:00:35.680 on how to incorporate --> 00:00:36.520 all of the learned --> 00:00:37.880 into a HYROX coaching, --> 00:00:38.960 and especially --> 00:00:40.960 into our interaction --> 00:00:43.160 with our clients. --> 00:00:44.600 So first of all, --> 00:00:46.280 what is communication? --> 00:00:47.520 Communication itself --> 00:00:49.880 is defined as the process --> 00:00:50.920 by which information --> 00:00:51.840 is exchanged --> 00:00:53.200 between individuals --> 00:00:54.480 through a common system --> 00:00:57.280 of symbols, signs, or behavior. --> 00:00:59.160 And this process involves --> 00:01:00.600 transmitting messages --> 00:01:01.760 between a sender --> 00:01:02.280 and one --> 00:01:03.440 or more recipients, --> 00:01:04.560 encompassing --> 00:01:06.120 not just the exchange --> 00:01:07.280 of information, --> 00:01:08.800 but also different --> 00:01:10.000 most motivational --> 00:01:11.440 states, emotions, --> 00:01:12.600 social aspects. --> 00:01:14.280 So communication goes --> 00:01:15.120 way beyond --> 00:01:17.200 simply conveying a message. --> 00:01:18.360 now Let's talk about the --> 00:01:19.800 two communication models. --> 00:01:20.760 And we'll start --> 00:01:21.960 with the communication --> 00:01:24.360 model from Schulz von Thun --> 00:01:25.440 So Schulz von Thun’s --> 00:01:26.880 model highlights --> 00:01:28.040 that communication --> 00:01:29.200 is multi-layered --> 00:01:31.040 involving more than just --> 00:01:32.520 the literal content --> 00:01:33.880 of the message. --> 00:01:35.280 And it is divided --> 00:01:36.720 into four aspects --> 00:01:39.120 which are the factual aspect. --> 00:01:41.200 The self revealing aspect. --> 00:01:42.840 The relationship aspect --> 00:01:44.040 and the appeal aspect, --> 00:01:45.240 which we come to later, --> 00:01:46.640 and the purpose of this model --> 00:01:48.000 is to understand --> 00:01:48.800 and improve --> 00:01:50.520 interpersonal communication --> 00:01:51.840 by recognizing --> 00:01:53.160 the different facets --> 00:01:54.680 that a message can have. --> 00:01:55.360 So let's explore --> 00:01:57.240 these four effects together. --> 00:01:58.520 Starting with the fact aspect. --> 00:02:00.360 The fact aspect --> 00:02:02.760 is defined as the factual --> 00:02:04.040 objective information --> 00:02:05.960 contained in the message. --> 00:02:06.680 the key question --> 00:02:07.760 here in analyzing --> 00:02:09.840 what has been said, is to ask --> 00:02:12.240 what am I informing about? --> 00:02:13.280 Because this aspect --> 00:02:15.400 is focusing on the data --> 00:02:17.240 and or the factual content --> 00:02:19.120 that is being communicated --> 00:02:20.480 and it requires --> 00:02:22.360 a high amount of accuracy --> 00:02:23.520 and clarity --> 00:02:25.160 to ensure --> 00:02:27.280 that the receiver understands --> 00:02:28.560 the factual information --> 00:02:29.320 correctly. --> 00:02:30.640 The second aspect is --> 00:02:32.240 the self revealing aspect, --> 00:02:33.120 which states --> 00:02:34.480 that every message --> 00:02:35.680 has a part of it --> 00:02:37.200 that reveals something --> 00:02:38.640 about the sender. --> 00:02:39.680 And the key question --> 00:02:40.240 to ask here --> 00:02:42.120 in analyzing communication is --> 00:02:43.320 what am I revealing --> 00:02:44.440 about myself? --> 00:02:45.640 Because a message --> 00:02:47.400 can unintentionally --> 00:02:48.160 or intentionally --> 00:02:49.560 convey --> 00:02:51.640 self-disclosure information --> 00:02:53.560 such as emotions, --> 00:02:55.080 values, motives, --> 00:02:56.040 or personality --> 00:02:57.800 traits of the sender. --> 00:02:59.120 And the purpose here --> 00:03:00.240 is to provide --> 00:03:01.920 insight into the sender's --> 00:03:03.120 internal state. --> 00:03:04.600 Fostering empathy --> 00:03:06.040 and understanding. --> 00:03:07.000 The third aspect --> 00:03:09.040 is the relationship aspect, --> 00:03:10.360 and it indicates --> 00:03:11.040 the sender's --> 00:03:12.760 view of the relationship --> 00:03:13.440 with the receiver --> 00:03:14.880 of the message. --> 00:03:16.080 This part of the message --> 00:03:17.560 reflects attitudes --> 00:03:19.080 towards the receiver --> 00:03:20.160 or --> 00:03:21.480 or even perceptions --> 00:03:22.880 of the receiver, --> 00:03:25.320 and can convey respect, --> 00:03:27.160 intimacy, authority, --> 00:03:28.960 but also disdain. --> 00:03:30.120 And the purpose --> 00:03:31.880 of this aspect is: --> 00:03:32.800 To communicate --> 00:03:34.000 relational dynamics --> 00:03:35.040 and attitudes --> 00:03:36.400 which influence --> 00:03:38.800 how messages are interpreted. --> 00:03:39.640 Last but not least, --> 00:03:41.160 there is the appeal aspect. --> 00:03:41.840 It's defined --> 00:03:42.760 as what the sender --> 00:03:44.000 of the message wants. --> 00:03:45.800 The receiver of the message --> 00:03:48.920 to do, think, feel, or act. --> 00:03:50.560 And the key question --> 00:03:51.640 to ask here is --> 00:03:53.200 what do I want you to do? --> 00:03:55.560 So what do I want you to do --> 00:03:57.080 with sending this message --> 00:03:57.680 to you? --> 00:03:58.640 And this can include --> 00:04:00.040 requests, commands, --> 00:04:00.960 suggestions, --> 00:04:03.400 or even persuasive elements. --> 00:04:03.960 And of course, --> 00:04:05.240 as we just mentioned, --> 00:04:06.760 the purpose of this appeal --> 00:04:07.400 aspect --> 00:04:09.400 is to direct or influence --> 00:04:10.920 the receiver's actions --> 00:04:12.520 and decisions --> 00:04:14.160 by conveying this appeal, --> 00:04:15.960 part of any message. --> 00:04:17.280 So just because these four aspects --> 00:04:18.040 are quite difficult --> 00:04:18.800 to understand --> 00:04:20.400 in actual communications. --> 00:04:21.920 let's jump into an example. --> 00:04:23.480 So imagine --> 00:04:25.200 the message that has been said --> 00:04:26.880 is your squad form --> 00:04:28.200 needs improvement --> 00:04:29.440 to prevent injuries, --> 00:04:30.600 which could happen --> 00:04:32.040 in any feedback session --> 00:04:32.640 that you have --> 00:04:33.480 with your clients. --> 00:04:34.800 So the fact aspect, --> 00:04:36.360 so only the content --> 00:04:37.400 that this message is --> 00:04:38.760 conveying is --> 00:04:40.200 your knees are extending --> 00:04:41.080 past your toes --> 00:04:42.040 during the squad, --> 00:04:44.120 which can cause a strain. --> 00:04:44.600 The self --> 00:04:45.400 revealing aspect --> 00:04:46.120 on the other hand, --> 00:04:47.560 which conveys information --> 00:04:48.240 about the self --> 00:04:50.400 disclosure is I'm concerned --> 00:04:51.480 about your safety --> 00:04:53.040 and want to make sure --> 00:04:54.760 you stay injury free. --> 00:04:55.240 Then there's the --> 00:04:56.360 relationship aspect --> 00:04:57.120 which says, --> 00:04:58.520 I care about your progress --> 00:04:59.160 and I'm here --> 00:05:00.680 to help you to improve. --> 00:05:01.520 Whilst the appeal --> 00:05:03.400 aspect can be interpreted --> 00:05:04.520 like, let's work --> 00:05:05.960 on adjusting your form --> 00:05:07.040 by keeping your knees --> 00:05:08.160 behind your toes. --> 00:05:09.040 So as you see, a --> 00:05:10.960 message can be broken down --> 00:05:12.440 into these four aspects. --> 00:05:14.840 And each of the four aspects --> 00:05:16.000 can be interpreted --> 00:05:18.240 different by each receiver. --> 00:05:19.560 So you need to make sure --> 00:05:20.880 that you know --> 00:05:22.080 how to influence them --> 00:05:23.360 and how to state them --> 00:05:24.200 really clear --> 00:05:25.880 to prevent misunderstandings --> 00:05:27.280 with your clients. --> 00:05:27.800 Well guys. --> 00:05:28.760 This was the first --> 00:05:29.600 communication model --> 00:05:31.000 that we will be covering --> 00:05:32.280 in this course. --> 00:05:33.120 But just because it --> 00:05:34.240 was so much content, --> 00:05:35.360 I decided to cut the --> 00:05:37.040 presentations in half. --> 00:05:38.120 So you can take your time --> 00:05:39.320 to reflect on the learned, --> 00:05:41.000 to reflect on the content, --> 00:05:41.960 and maybe answer --> 00:05:43.160 the example on screen. --> 00:05:43.880 Right now. --> 00:05:45.320 And I will see you guys --> 00:05:46.280 in the next video. Chapter: Communication Models 2 --> 00:00:00.880 Welcome back guys to --> 00:00:01.960 our second presentation --> 00:00:04.000 on communication models. --> 00:00:05.360 Now that we've seen --> 00:00:07.160 how a message can be split up --> 00:00:08.800 into four different aspects, --> 00:00:10.280 we will now continue --> 00:00:11.360 with the second --> 00:00:12.200 communication model --> 00:00:12.960 which is --> 00:00:14.240 the communication model --> 00:00:16.160 by Paul Watzlawick --> 00:00:18.000 So this communication model --> 00:00:20.440 consists of five key axioms, --> 00:00:22.480 which are basically just rules --> 00:00:23.880 for communication --> 00:00:25.200 Which provide insights --> 00:00:26.960 into the inherent nature --> 00:00:28.520 of human interaction, --> 00:00:30.560 highlighting the complexities --> 00:00:31.880 and the nuances --> 00:00:34.280 of communication and knowing. --> 00:00:35.800 these axioms help us --> 00:00:37.720 to understand the dynamics --> 00:00:40.160 of interpersonal communication. --> 00:00:41.600 The first axiom is stated --> 00:00:44.600 as one cannot not communicate. --> 00:00:45.760 It basically means that --> 00:00:46.520 every behavior --> 00:00:49.200 is some form of communication. --> 00:00:50.160 And this means --> 00:00:51.440 that even silence --> 00:00:53.280 or complete inactivity --> 00:00:55.200 can communicate something. --> 00:00:56.280 And the purpose of this axiom --> 00:00:57.840 is to emphasize --> 00:00:59.400 the inevitability --> 00:01:00.760 of communication --> 00:01:02.840 in social interactions. --> 00:01:04.440 Then comes the second axiom, --> 00:01:05.240 which is stated --> 00:01:07.200 as every communication --> 00:01:08.400 has a content --> 00:01:09.480 and the relationship --> 00:01:10.560 aspect. --> 00:01:11.680 Therefore each message --> 00:01:13.160 conveys a content, --> 00:01:15.240 so the actual information --> 00:01:15.960 of the message --> 00:01:17.360 that's being communicated --> 00:01:20.160 and the relationship between --> 00:01:21.800 or the perceived relationship --> 00:01:23.680 between the communicators, --> 00:01:25.120 which can either be --> 00:01:26.200 I recognize you --> 00:01:27.400 as superior to me --> 00:01:28.840 or subordinate to me. --> 00:01:30.240 And the purpose of this axiom, --> 00:01:31.280 is to highlight --> 00:01:33.000 the dual nature of messages --> 00:01:33.880 and their impact --> 00:01:34.800 on relationships. --> 00:01:35.880 The third axiom, on --> 00:01:37.120 the other hand, is stated --> 00:01:39.400 as the nature of a relationship --> 00:01:40.440 is dependent --> 00:01:41.520 on the punctuation --> 00:01:42.160 of the partner's --> 00:01:44.120 communication procedures. --> 00:01:44.600 Don't worry --> 00:01:45.760 sounds pretty complex, --> 00:01:47.000 but I'm going to break it down --> 00:01:48.000 for you in a minute. --> 00:01:48.280 So, --> 00:01:49.880 the definition is basically --> 00:01:51.960 that communication sequences --> 00:01:54.000 are interpreted differently --> 00:01:55.200 by each participant. --> 00:01:56.040 Just as I said --> 00:01:57.520 in the previous model. --> 00:01:58.640 Every individual --> 00:02:00.280 has its own preferences --> 00:02:02.440 to interpreting a message --> 00:02:04.280 based on different factors. --> 00:02:05.200 In addition to that, --> 00:02:06.040 you need to know --> 00:02:07.120 that punctuation --> 00:02:08.600 in this context means --> 00:02:10.680 how communicators interpret --> 00:02:11.320 the start --> 00:02:12.280 and the end --> 00:02:14.360 of the communication sequence. --> 00:02:15.280 And differences --> 00:02:16.800 in, in this punctuation --> 00:02:18.040 or this perception --> 00:02:18.840 of what --> 00:02:20.520 the message tried to convey --> 00:02:22.360 can lead to misunderstandings --> 00:02:23.600 and conflicts --> 00:02:24.200 between the --> 00:02:25.720 communication partners. --> 00:02:27.400 So the purpose of this axiom --> 00:02:29.080 is to emphasize --> 00:02:30.600 the subjective nature --> 00:02:31.960 of interpreting --> 00:02:33.400 communication sequence. --> 00:02:34.720 The fourth axiom states --> 00:02:35.880 that human beings --> 00:02:38.000 communicate both digitally --> 00:02:39.160 and logically. --> 00:02:41.400 So just to just to clarify --> 00:02:43.000 these terms real quick for you. --> 00:02:44.200 Digital means --> 00:02:45.520 verbal communication --> 00:02:47.640 with specific, clear meanings. --> 00:02:49.560 Analogical means --> 00:02:51.040 nonverbal components --> 00:02:52.320 of the communication --> 00:02:53.480 that are often --> 00:02:55.080 expressing emotions, --> 00:02:56.760 or relational dynamics, --> 00:02:58.120 such as the body language --> 00:02:59.480 of the communicators, --> 00:02:59.840 Therefore. --> 00:03:01.400 This axiom says that --> 00:03:03.160 every communication involves --> 00:03:04.600 both verbal --> 00:03:07.240 and nonverbal components. --> 00:03:09.280 And the purpose of this axiom --> 00:03:10.480 is to highlight --> 00:03:11.720 the importance --> 00:03:13.040 of both the verbal --> 00:03:13.880 and the non verbal --> 00:03:15.320 communication patterns --> 00:03:17.280 in conveying messages. --> 00:03:18.120 Last but not least, --> 00:03:19.680 we have the fifth axiom, --> 00:03:20.400 which states --> 00:03:21.600 that communication --> 00:03:23.640 can either be symmetrical --> 00:03:25.000 or complementary. --> 00:03:26.960 Same procedure as last axiom. --> 00:03:28.360 Symmetrical means --> 00:03:30.720 interactions that are equal --> 00:03:32.360 and minimizing differences --> 00:03:33.640 between the communication --> 00:03:34.400 partners. --> 00:03:36.120 And complementary means --> 00:03:37.120 interactions --> 00:03:39.120 that emphasize differences, --> 00:03:41.640 often based on different roles. --> 00:03:42.640 For our example, --> 00:03:44.160 it can be the difference --> 00:03:45.840 between a coach and the player --> 00:03:46.640 and their roles --> 00:03:48.600 in the communication setup. --> 00:03:50.720 So this axiom basically states --> 00:03:53.120 that communication interactions --> 00:03:55.160 are always based on either --> 00:03:56.120 equality --> 00:03:57.880 which would be symmetrical, --> 00:03:59.720 or the differences --> 00:04:00.360 which would be the --> 00:04:01.680 complementary part --> 00:04:03.840 in power and roles --> 00:04:04.320 between these --> 00:04:06.080 two communication partners. --> 00:04:07.800 And the purpose of this axiom --> 00:04:08.960 is to explain --> 00:04:10.880 that the dynamics of power --> 00:04:12.160 play a big role --> 00:04:14.160 in communication itself. --> 00:04:15.240 So now that we have had --> 00:04:17.040 a lot of theoretical input. --> 00:04:18.080 Now let's talk about --> 00:04:19.360 the implementation --> 00:04:21.080 into our HYROX use case. --> 00:04:23.080 To reduce misunderstandings --> 00:04:24.200 in our communication --> 00:04:24.840 with our clients --> 00:04:26.880 as much as we possibly can, --> 00:04:28.680 we should definitely provide --> 00:04:30.320 clear and specific information. --> 00:04:32.040 So there's no misunderstanding --> 00:04:34.080 in this aspect whatsoever. --> 00:04:35.560 and then know that we know --> 00:04:37.240 that every message contains --> 00:04:38.560 a relationship aspect, --> 00:04:39.920 we use this knowledge --> 00:04:40.760 to maintain --> 00:04:42.200 a positive relationship --> 00:04:43.560 with our clients. --> 00:04:45.400 Then we need to give clear, --> 00:04:47.400 actionable instructions --> 00:04:48.120 and reinforce --> 00:04:49.280 what has been said through --> 00:04:51.000 non-verbal behavior. --> 00:04:51.760 Talking about --> 00:04:53.240 nonverbal communication, --> 00:04:54.080 we as coaches --> 00:04:56.200 definitely need to be aware --> 00:04:57.640 of our own nonverbal --> 00:04:59.040 communication behavior, --> 00:05:00.000 Because we now know --> 00:05:01.240 that every single part --> 00:05:02.920 of our nonverbal behavior --> 00:05:04.080 can convey --> 00:05:05.960 some kind of relation dynamic --> 00:05:07.280 to our clients. --> 00:05:08.440 Then we definitely need --> 00:05:10.520 to understand the punctuation --> 00:05:12.000 of the communication partners. --> 00:05:12.680 In other words, --> 00:05:14.120 we need to understand --> 00:05:15.200 cause and effect --> 00:05:16.160 in communication --> 00:05:17.960 that each message --> 00:05:20.120 can be interpreted differently, --> 00:05:21.560 so we can actively eradicate --> 00:05:22.960 misunderstandings --> 00:05:23.800 in what we want --> 00:05:26.040 our clients to actually do. --> 00:05:26.880 Last but not least, --> 00:05:27.760 we need to adjust --> 00:05:28.880 our communication style --> 00:05:30.840 appropriately to the situation --> 00:05:32.320 that we find ourselves in, --> 00:05:33.440 to ultimately --> 00:05:34.880 include all of the knowledge --> 00:05:36.000 we've just gained --> 00:05:37.600 to guide the interaction --> 00:05:39.080 into a direction --> 00:05:40.320 that we can benefit --> 00:05:41.640 from as coaches. --> 00:05:42.720 Well that's it for this --> 00:05:43.640 presentation, guys. --> 00:05:44.880 Thank you for your attention. --> 00:05:45.640 I hope you enjoyed --> 00:05:46.720 and learned something. --> 00:05:47.560 There are no review --> 00:05:48.640 questions today. --> 00:05:49.800 And if you'd like to, --> 00:05:50.560 you can continue --> 00:05:51.760 to the next lesson --> 00:05:52.840 or pause the video --> 00:05:53.880 or go back to --> 00:05:54.920 some of the communication --> 00:05:56.800 models we've just discussed. --> 00:05:58.320 Just to go through it again --> 00:05:59.880 or reflect on the learned. --> 00:06:01.200 And I will see you guys --> 00:06:03.320 in the next lesson. Cheers."

Chapter: Body language --> 00:00:01.240 Hello everyone and welcome --> 00:00:02.480 to this presentation. --> 00:00:03.120 Today --> 00:00:04.440 we will be discussing --> 00:00:06.480 the importance of body language --> 00:00:08.880 and how we can use the understanding --> 00:00:09.840 of body language --> 00:00:11.480 that clients show to us, --> 00:00:14.040 to our advantage in coaching. --> 00:00:15.320 Therefore, we will first dive --> 00:00:16.400 into the definition --> 00:00:17.160 of body language. --> 00:00:18.400 So what is body language --> 00:00:19.160 and what different --> 00:00:21.160 types of body language are there. --> 00:00:22.480 And then we're going to take a look --> 00:00:24.040 at three different examples --> 00:00:25.480 from body language. --> 00:00:26.600 And after this --> 00:00:27.960 at the end of this presentation --> 00:00:30.040 we will be implementing them --> 00:00:31.120 into our HYROX --> 00:00:32.400 coaching strategy. --> 00:00:33.800 So without further ado, let's --> 00:00:35.640 get straight into this presentation. --> 00:00:36.680 So body language itself --> 00:00:38.760 refers to the whole conglomeration --> 00:00:40.040 of non-verbal signals --> 00:00:40.920 that we as humans --> 00:00:42.640 use to communicate. --> 00:00:43.440 They include --> 00:00:44.640 facial expressions, --> 00:00:45.800 body postures, --> 00:00:48.000 gestures, your eye movement, --> 00:00:49.800 your touch, and the use of space. --> 00:00:52.800 So the the way you take up space --> 00:00:54.120 with your extremities. --> 00:00:57.000 And the interesting fact is --> 00:00:59.280 that it makes up to 80% --> 00:01:00.760 of our everyday communication. --> 00:01:03.600 So 80% of all of our communication --> 00:01:04.800 every single day --> 00:01:07.040 is from a body language. --> 00:01:07.600 and therefore --> 00:01:08.760 there are a lot of messages --> 00:01:10.600 that we are transporting --> 00:01:11.840 through the body language, --> 00:01:14.800 And some of them may also be hidden. --> 00:01:16.360 the three types of body language --> 00:01:18.320 that we will be taking look at today --> 00:01:19.880 are facial expressions, --> 00:01:20.960 body posture, --> 00:01:23.320 and the placement of extremities. --> 00:01:24.320 So let's start --> 00:01:26.240 with the facial expressions. --> 00:01:29.240 So facial expressions are probably --> 00:01:31.080 the most commonly known --> 00:01:32.400 thing of body language --> 00:01:33.880 because we are confronted --> 00:01:35.280 with them all the time --> 00:01:37.000 and all day long. --> 00:01:38.000 And everyone knows --> 00:01:39.560 that facial expressions --> 00:01:41.200 can convey our emotions --> 00:01:42.320 and intentions. --> 00:01:44.680 But what most people don't know is --> 00:01:45.920 that facial --> 00:01:47.120 expressions can --> 00:01:50.040 also be subconsciously influenced. --> 00:01:50.560 that means --> 00:01:51.720 that our facial expressions --> 00:01:54.120 sometimes reflect inner states --> 00:01:54.520 that we are --> 00:01:56.280 not even conscious about. --> 00:01:57.400 For us as coaches, it's --> 00:01:58.480 very important to know --> 00:02:00.280 at least the key expressions. --> 00:02:01.840 And those key expressions --> 00:02:03.280 are happiness, --> 00:02:04.400 which is characterized --> 00:02:05.920 by of course smiling. --> 00:02:07.240 And the eyes are crinkling --> 00:02:08.400 at the corners. --> 00:02:11.040 and sadness, which is characterized --> 00:02:12.840 by frowning, a downturned --> 00:02:14.960 mouth and drooping eyelids. --> 00:02:15.680 Then, of course, --> 00:02:17.760 the emotion of surprise, --> 00:02:18.920 which is characterized --> 00:02:20.720 by a raised eyebrows, --> 00:02:21.800 wide open eyes, --> 00:02:24.360 and sometimes even an open mouth. --> 00:02:26.440 If this surprise is very big, --> 00:02:27.560 Then there is fear, --> 00:02:28.680 which is characterized --> 00:02:29.560 by wide eyes --> 00:02:30.720 and open mouth, --> 00:02:31.640 and the eyebrows --> 00:02:33.640 are slightly drawn together. --> 00:02:35.080 The emotion of anger --> 00:02:37.520 is characterized by forward brows --> 00:02:38.840 and a clenched jaw --> 00:02:40.480 and very narrowed eyes. --> 00:02:42.280 So your face is really tensed up --> 00:02:43.720 when you feel anger. --> 00:02:45.320 Then there's disgust, --> 00:02:47.040 which is also characterized --> 00:02:48.680 by a wrinkled nose --> 00:02:51.280 and a raised upper lip sometimes, --> 00:02:52.680 and contempt, --> 00:02:55.600 which is characterized by smirking --> 00:02:57.400 the lip corners are tightened. --> 00:02:58.960 With body posture, --> 00:03:00.840 it needs to be said that it reflects --> 00:03:02.120 or personal information. --> 00:03:04.040 so it reflects your confidence, --> 00:03:06.600 your openness to new experiences, --> 00:03:07.560 your attentiveness --> 00:03:10.320 and also your relation to others. --> 00:03:12.360 So the open posture is characterized --> 00:03:15.360 by a relaxed stance on both legs. --> 00:03:16.840 And your arms are not crossed --> 00:03:18.600 and your legs are not crossed either. --> 00:03:19.920 A closed posture, on the other --> 00:03:21.280 hand, is characterized --> 00:03:22.880 by crossed arms or legs --> 00:03:24.880 and hunched shoulders. --> 00:03:26.720 Then there is the confident posture --> 00:03:28.600 which we see in many athletes, --> 00:03:29.640 which is characterized --> 00:03:31.560 by an upright stance --> 00:03:33.040 your shoulders are taking back. --> 00:03:34.800 You have a wide open chest, --> 00:03:36.920 and you really take up space --> 00:03:37.800 around you --> 00:03:39.200 and really display --> 00:03:41.000 that you are confident person. --> 00:03:41.640 And then there's --> 00:03:43.120 the attentive posture which you. --> 00:03:45.880 oftentimes see in conversations --> 00:03:47.240 because the attentive posture --> 00:03:48.320 is displayed through --> 00:03:49.840 leaning slightly forward --> 00:03:51.360 and nodding in conversation. --> 00:03:53.800 So you display the person --> 00:03:55.040 you are interacting with, --> 00:03:56.680 that you are actively listening --> 00:03:57.200 to them. --> 00:03:58.760 And being interested --> 00:04:00.240 in what they have to say. --> 00:04:01.720 the third aspect of body language --> 00:04:02.920 that we will be talking about --> 00:04:04.360 today is the positioning --> 00:04:05.800 of your arms, legs, --> 00:04:06.800 hands and feet --> 00:04:08.080 and the use of space --> 00:04:09.360 or the proximity --> 00:04:10.040 you keep --> 00:04:12.160 between your interaction partners. --> 00:04:13.800 The key positions to look out for. --> 00:04:15.240 Here are your arms, --> 00:04:16.920 your legs, your hands, your feet, --> 00:04:17.640 and the space. --> 00:04:19.200 Of course, as I just mentioned. --> 00:04:20.880 So the key positions of your arms --> 00:04:22.520 are either open and relaxed, --> 00:04:23.880 which displays, --> 00:04:25.080 a openness --> 00:04:27.240 for new situations, new experiences, --> 00:04:28.760 new interaction or partners, --> 00:04:30.000 or your arms are crossed --> 00:04:30.880 and really tensed up, --> 00:04:32.160 which displays --> 00:04:33.680 that you are not interested --> 00:04:35.120 in the situation --> 00:04:36.360 or you oftentimes --> 00:04:37.720 see this in an argument --> 00:04:38.920 where people --> 00:04:40.960 try to vehemently remain --> 00:04:42.080 on what they said. --> 00:04:43.000 Then there are your legs, --> 00:04:43.680 and your legs --> 00:04:45.440 can also have an open --> 00:04:47.880 stance, pretty relaxed on both feet. --> 00:04:49.040 Or your legs are close --> 00:04:50.360 or crossed over each other, --> 00:04:51.680 which is displaying --> 00:04:53.680 kind of a defensive stance --> 00:04:55.000 and showing --> 00:04:56.400 that you are not, --> 00:04:57.280 feeling comfortable --> 00:04:58.800 in the situation. --> 00:05:00.320 So when it comes to your hands, --> 00:05:02.680 you can either gesture naturally --> 00:05:03.840 and very much, --> 00:05:05.040 or you hide them, --> 00:05:05.960 or you see people --> 00:05:07.640 fidgeting with the hands. --> 00:05:09.160 So you always have to have --> 00:05:10.080 something in your hand --> 00:05:11.680 and fidget around. This displays --> 00:05:13.600 that you are feeling kind of nervous --> 00:05:15.600 and uncomfortable in this situation. --> 00:05:17.800 Whereas if you are gesturing --> 00:05:18.240 you again, --> 00:05:20.240 take up a lot of space around you --> 00:05:21.000 and display --> 00:05:22.960 being perceived as open --> 00:05:24.040 and pretty confident --> 00:05:25.040 and what's pretty interesting --> 00:05:25.760 is that studies --> 00:05:26.320 show that --> 00:05:28.000 if you are in a situation --> 00:05:29.680 where you need to present something --> 00:05:30.720 that people, --> 00:05:32.000 that people will rate you --> 00:05:33.360 as more reliable --> 00:05:34.240 when you are pointing --> 00:05:36.320 with your palms facing upwards. --> 00:05:38.280 So if you are having a presentation, --> 00:05:39.840 try to keep your palms upwards --> 00:05:41.680 and see how the people react to it. --> 00:05:43.320 Then of course there are the feet. --> 00:05:44.640 And the feet is very, --> 00:05:45.520 very interesting --> 00:05:47.320 because most of the time --> 00:05:49.880 your feet are subconsciously --> 00:05:51.360 pointing in the direction --> 00:05:52.800 that you want to go to. --> 00:05:54.560 So if you are in the conversation --> 00:05:56.400 where you are talking with somebody, --> 00:05:57.160 most of the times --> 00:05:58.160 if you don't want to be --> 00:05:59.240 in this conversation, --> 00:06:00.440 your feet will point --> 00:06:02.240 to the direction you'd like to go. --> 00:06:03.400 Maybe to the door, --> 00:06:05.520 or maybe to the bus or something. --> 00:06:07.200 Wherever the situation is. --> 00:06:08.760 And then of course there's the space --> 00:06:10.800 between union interaction partner. --> 00:06:11.960 The proximity --> 00:06:12.920 most of the times --> 00:06:15.080 reflect how close you are --> 00:06:16.760 to your interaction partner. --> 00:06:17.920 So the closer you stand, --> 00:06:18.640 the more likely --> 00:06:20.480 you are to have a great relation --> 00:06:21.920 and the other way around. --> 00:06:22.840 Now that we've talked --> 00:06:24.160 about these three basic --> 00:06:25.800 aspects of body language, --> 00:06:26.760 let's explain them --> 00:06:28.320 and implement them into our HYROX --> 00:06:29.080 Use case. --> 00:06:30.440 so the first use case for us --> 00:06:30.960 would be --> 00:06:33.160 when we are demonstrating exercises. --> 00:06:33.960 and when we are --> 00:06:35.520 demonstrating exercises, --> 00:06:36.240 we can, --> 00:06:37.400 first of all, exhibit --> 00:06:40.160 a clear and a confident body posture --> 00:06:41.680 to set a strong example --> 00:06:43.240 for our clients. --> 00:06:44.800 Then we have to use --> 00:06:46.080 deliberate hand gestures. --> 00:06:48.080 As I just said, with palms --> 00:06:48.840 facing upwards --> 00:06:49.840 most of the times --> 00:06:51.600 and throughout this, maintain --> 00:06:53.200 eye contact to ensure --> 00:06:54.040 that our clients --> 00:06:55.800 understand the instructions. --> 00:06:56.600 Then, whilst --> 00:06:57.640 providing feedback, --> 00:06:59.000 we have to show empathy --> 00:07:00.400 through our facial expressions --> 00:07:02.320 and attentive body posture --> 00:07:03.600 when addressing client --> 00:07:04.840 concerns or frustration. --> 00:07:07.640 So this basically means keep a smile --> 00:07:09.120 and maybe lean forward --> 00:07:11.840 to your client sometimes and nod. --> 00:07:12.400 And nod --> 00:07:13.480 if you understand --> 00:07:14.760 what they are saying. --> 00:07:16.280 So just give them the feeling --> 00:07:17.480 that they are heard. --> 00:07:18.480 Then in addition to that, --> 00:07:19.960 we use an open --> 00:07:22.080 and relaxed arm position --> 00:07:23.680 to create a supportive --> 00:07:25.600 and a non defensive environment --> 00:07:27.480 During these feedback sessions. --> 00:07:28.160 Another way --> 00:07:29.240 to use body language --> 00:07:29.840 in our HYROX --> 00:07:31.880 coaching is to build rapport. --> 00:07:32.760 So we use a technique --> 00:07:33.800 called mirroring --> 00:07:35.560 where we mirror our client's --> 00:07:37.240 body language subtly --> 00:07:38.160 to build rapport --> 00:07:39.600 and show our understanding. --> 00:07:41.080 because your clients will feel --> 00:07:42.320 more comfortable --> 00:07:43.840 if you kind of display --> 00:07:44.880 the same body language --> 00:07:45.880 that they are showing. --> 00:07:46.960 And whilst doing this, --> 00:07:48.760 we keep appropriate eye contact --> 00:07:49.880 to further build trust --> 00:07:51.320 and demonstrate attentiveness. --> 00:07:52.280 again. --> 00:07:53.240 Body language also comes in handy --> 00:07:54.240 when we are creating --> 00:07:55.720 a positive environment --> 00:07:58.120 so we can use our open body posture --> 00:08:00.040 and the positive facial --> 00:08:01.800 to create a welcoming --> 00:08:04.320 and very inclusive atmosphere --> 00:08:05.600 and of course not to forget, --> 00:08:07.160 we can use our knowledge --> 00:08:08.160 of body language --> 00:08:09.640 to read our clients --> 00:08:11.720 so we can recognize early cues --> 00:08:13.320 of underlying statements --> 00:08:14.280 in the body language, --> 00:08:15.440 as I just told you --> 00:08:16.680 and then act accordingly --> 00:08:18.480 to what your clients show to you. --> 00:08:19.720 Well, guys, that's it --> 00:08:21.200 for today's presentation. --> 00:08:22.080 I hope you enjoyed --> 00:08:24.120 and learned something new. --> 00:08:25.680 Here are a few review questions --> 00:08:26.520 that you can answer, --> 00:08:27.440 If you'd like to --> 00:08:28.880 just pause the video right here --> 00:08:30.240 If you want to do so, --> 00:08:30.960 if not, --> 00:08:32.720 just continue to the next lesson. --> 00:08:33.760 And I would like to thank you --> 00:08:34.680 for your attention --> 00:08:36.400 and see you in the next video."

Chapter: Principles of Motivation --> 00:00:00.840 Hello everyone, and --> 00:00:02.400 welcome to this presentation --> 00:00:02.880 inside --> 00:00:04.640 of the Art of coaching module. --> 00:00:05.200 Our topic --> 00:00:06.840 today will be the different --> 00:00:08.280 Motivational Basics. --> 00:00:09.840 More specifically speaking --> 00:00:11.520 we will look at the three --> 00:00:12.920 different motivational modules --> 00:00:14.040 from psychology --> 00:00:15.280 and how we can apply --> 00:00:16.080 this knowledge --> 00:00:17.760 of the theoretic models --> 00:00:18.400 inside --> 00:00:19.800 of our training conception --> 00:00:21.880 into our hierarchs coaching. --> 00:00:22.800 Therefore I will first --> 00:00:24.240 give you a quick overview --> 00:00:24.720 of what --> 00:00:26.200 motivation is defined as --> 00:00:27.000 and what motivates --> 00:00:28.640 drive or motivation. --> 00:00:29.840 Then we will take a look --> 00:00:30.880 at three specific --> 00:00:31.920 motivational theories --> 00:00:33.080 from psychology, --> 00:00:34.640 as well as explain them --> 00:00:35.640 and implement them. --> 00:00:36.240 Lastly --> 00:00:38.640 into our HYROX coaching. --> 00:00:40.560 So what is motivation? --> 00:00:41.760 Motivation is defined --> 00:00:43.120 as the process, --> 00:00:43.800 the process --> 00:00:45.480 that initiates, guides --> 00:00:46.880 and sustains our goal --> 00:00:48.400 oriented behavior. --> 00:00:50.360 So really gives us the drive --> 00:00:51.360 to follow whatever --> 00:00:53.000 we are motivated for. --> 00:00:54.240 And it can be influenced --> 00:00:55.280 by internal --> 00:00:56.680 or external factors, --> 00:00:57.960 as we will see later on --> 00:00:59.080 in this presentation. --> 00:01:00.360 Contrary to that, --> 00:01:01.040 we have the internal --> 00:01:01.760 we have the internal --> 00:01:03.720 needs, desires or reasons --> 00:01:05.200 which are called motives --> 00:01:05.920 and these motives --> 00:01:08.240 prompt our action. --> 00:01:09.960 So there is no process --> 00:01:10.760 of motivation --> 00:01:12.200 without an initial prompt --> 00:01:13.800 that the motives give us. --> 00:01:14.920 And these motives --> 00:01:15.760 can vary --> 00:01:17.280 among every individual --> 00:01:18.840 because they are influenced --> 00:01:20.880 by our norms or values, --> 00:01:22.080 our culture. --> 00:01:22.800 Basically, --> 00:01:24.160 everything that defines --> 00:01:24.920 who we are --> 00:01:26.560 can influence our motives. --> 00:01:28.280 So now that we know --> 00:01:29.840 what motivation is --> 00:01:30.680 and that there are --> 00:01:31.760 underlying motives --> 00:01:33.360 that prompt our action. --> 00:01:34.360 Let's look at --> 00:01:35.560 how the motivation --> 00:01:36.920 actually builds up. --> 00:01:37.760 And therefore --> 00:01:38.720 we will take a look --> 00:01:40.200 at three different motivation --> 00:01:41.720 theories from psychology, --> 00:01:42.920 which is the Maslow's --> 00:01:43.920 hierarchy of needs. --> 00:01:45.200 The intrinsic versus --> 00:01:47.200 extrinsic motivation model --> 00:01:48.640 and the self-determination --> 00:01:50.480 theory by Deci &amp; Ryan. --> 00:01:51.480 So without further --> 00:01:52.840 ado, let's start --> 00:01:53.760 with the Maslow's --> 00:01:55.000 Hierarchy of needs. --> 00:01:55.520 Well, --> 00:01:56.040 the Maslow’s --> 00:01:56.760 hierarchy of needs --> 00:01:57.240 is probably --> 00:01:58.400 one of the most commonly --> 00:01:59.960 known motivation theories, --> 00:02:00.600 but I wanted to --> 00:02:02.040 bring it to you nonetheless, --> 00:02:03.280 because it really pictures --> 00:02:04.240 a framework --> 00:02:05.160 to understand --> 00:02:06.360 the wide range --> 00:02:07.800 of human motivation, --> 00:02:09.360 because it outlines --> 00:02:11.040 this hierarchical structure --> 00:02:11.640 of human --> 00:02:12.920 needs that build up --> 00:02:14.040 to the highest point --> 00:02:15.840 of human motivation. --> 00:02:16.720 inside of this --> 00:02:18.000 hierarchical structure, --> 00:02:20.080 every need has to be fulfilled --> 00:02:21.640 in a sequential order --> 00:02:23.560 to reach the next step --> 00:02:25.680 in the motivation pyramid. --> 00:02:27.200 The starting point is always --> 00:02:28.760 our basic physiological needs. --> 00:02:30.920 So hunger, thirst, shelter --> 00:02:31.840 and so on. --> 00:02:32.960 After that, we progress --> 00:02:33.640 into higher --> 00:02:34.960 psychological needs like --> 00:02:36.760 the need for social relations, --> 00:02:38.000 the need for self-love, --> 00:02:40.080 and so on and so on. --> 00:02:40.440 and this --> 00:02:41.440 hierarchical structure --> 00:02:43.360 of the motivation based on --> 00:02:44.600 the human needs --> 00:02:45.440 is applicable --> 00:02:47.680 to any everyday context. --> 00:02:48.920 let's start with the basic --> 00:02:49.920 physiological needs --> 00:02:51.280 that need to be fulfilled --> 00:02:52.480 in order to progress --> 00:02:53.680 even further. --> 00:02:55.160 So the physiological needs --> 00:02:56.680 is the fundamental level --> 00:02:57.600 of the pyramid. --> 00:02:59.640 And it contains our basic --> 00:03:01.320 biological requirements --> 00:03:02.480 for survival. --> 00:03:03.240 For example, --> 00:03:03.640 as I just --> 00:03:04.080 said, --> 00:03:05.520 food, water, --> 00:03:07.440 shelter and sleep. --> 00:03:08.720 Once these physiological --> 00:03:09.920 needs are fulfilled, --> 00:03:11.520 we progress into the safety --> 00:03:13.120 and security category. --> 00:03:14.960 And these are the desires --> 00:03:16.200 for physical --> 00:03:18.320 and psychological security --> 00:03:19.480 and protection --> 00:03:21.000 from harm and danger. --> 00:03:21.800 once our basic --> 00:03:22.760 physiological needs, --> 00:03:24.960 as well as the need for safety --> 00:03:26.640 and security is fulfilled, --> 00:03:27.160 We progress --> 00:03:27.840 into higher --> 00:03:29.360 social relationship needs, --> 00:03:30.160 which are the love --> 00:03:31.600 and belongingness needs --> 00:03:33.200 And these needs picture --> 00:03:34.000 a desire --> 00:03:35.680 for social connection, --> 00:03:37.560 acceptance and friendship. --> 00:03:39.400 So just overall --> 00:03:41.240 social relationships. --> 00:03:42.520 once an individual --> 00:03:43.640 has no issues --> 00:03:45.520 in the first three categories, --> 00:03:46.920 They progress into the fourth --> 00:03:48.080 needs category, --> 00:03:50.360 which is the self esteem needs --> 00:03:51.320 and the self esteem needs --> 00:03:53.280 are categorized by a desire --> 00:03:56.040 for self-respect, confidence, --> 00:03:57.920 recognition of others, --> 00:03:59.560 and the underlying desire --> 00:04:00.760 to earn respect --> 00:04:02.640 and admiration of others. --> 00:04:03.200 And only --> 00:04:04.520 if all of those previous --> 00:04:05.640 needs are fulfilled, --> 00:04:06.320 we progress --> 00:04:07.240 in the highest --> 00:04:08.480 category of needs, --> 00:04:09.040 which are --> 00:04:10.680 the self-actualization needs. --> 00:04:11.840 self-actualization needs --> 00:04:12.880 are defined --> 00:04:14.240 by the pursuit --> 00:04:15.360 of personal growth --> 00:04:16.920 and the realization --> 00:04:18.200 of one's talents, --> 00:04:20.400 and the wish to fulfill --> 00:04:21.360 one's own --> 00:04:23.800 full potential to the maximum. --> 00:04:24.760 to summarize, --> 00:04:26.560 only if every single --> 00:04:28.240 step of the pyramid --> 00:04:29.320 is fulfilled, --> 00:04:30.280 Humans can now --> 00:04:31.520 pursue their way --> 00:04:32.680 of becoming the best --> 00:04:33.760 version of themselves. --> 00:04:35.920 The next motivational --> 00:04:36.960 theory that we will be --> 00:04:37.880 taking a look at in --> 00:04:39.040 this presentation --> 00:04:40.400 is the intrinsic versus --> 00:04:42.880 extrinsic motivation theory. --> 00:04:43.840 So let's start --> 00:04:46.200 with the extrinsic motivation. --> 00:04:47.800 The extrinsic motivation says --> 00:04:49.400 that motivation is sparked --> 00:04:51.200 from outside of oneself. --> 00:04:52.160 That means that --> 00:04:52.920 if you remember --> 00:04:53.880 the first slide, --> 00:04:55.240 the motives that drive --> 00:04:56.880 the process of motivation --> 00:04:58.160 are, in this case, --> 00:04:59.400 external factors --> 00:05:00.640 that drive our engagement --> 00:05:01.960 in an activity. --> 00:05:03.720 And these external factors --> 00:05:04.920 are any kind --> 00:05:06.520 of external rewards. --> 00:05:07.440 For example, --> 00:05:09.280 money recognition, --> 00:05:12.120 praises, badges, and so on. --> 00:05:13.240 And there is no --> 00:05:14.680 specific interest --> 00:05:16.800 in the activity itself. --> 00:05:18.120 Intrinsic motivation, --> 00:05:19.680 on the other hand, picture --> 00:05:21.960 is that the motivation derives --> 00:05:23.680 from inside of oneself. --> 00:05:24.480 That means it's --> 00:05:26.000 the exact opposite --> 00:05:27.920 of the extrinsic motivation. --> 00:05:28.760 and it pictures --> 00:05:29.960 that the activity --> 00:05:31.480 or the task itself --> 00:05:31.760 brings --> 00:05:34.160 so much inherent satisfaction --> 00:05:35.240 to an individual --> 00:05:36.080 that he or --> 00:05:37.280 she pursues --> 00:05:38.240 this activity --> 00:05:40.560 only for the activity itself. --> 00:05:41.160 Therefore, --> 00:05:42.760 there are no external rewards --> 00:05:44.400 included whatsoever, --> 00:05:45.280 and individuals --> 00:05:46.760 are purely motivated --> 00:05:48.440 by their personal interests --> 00:05:49.400 or passions, --> 00:05:50.320 or the enjoyment --> 00:05:52.720 that the task itself brings. --> 00:05:53.800 the third and final --> 00:05:54.760 motivation theory --> 00:05:55.320 that we will be --> 00:05:56.320 taking a look at --> 00:05:57.680 is the self-determination --> 00:06:00.080 theory by DeSean Ryan. --> 00:06:01.040 This theory --> 00:06:03.560 focuses on the motivation --> 00:06:05.400 behind human behavior, --> 00:06:06.960 and is a complex --> 00:06:08.840 result of an interaction --> 00:06:10.400 between three pillars. --> 00:06:11.520 And these three pillars --> 00:06:12.800 are autonomy, --> 00:06:15.360 competence and relatedness. --> 00:06:16.560 in this context, --> 00:06:17.760 autonomy refers --> 00:06:19.680 to the need to be in control --> 00:06:21.720 of one's own action choices --> 00:06:22.360 and to act --> 00:06:24.560 accordingly to your own values --> 00:06:25.480 and norms, --> 00:06:26.440 and therefore experience --> 00:06:27.720 a sense of volition --> 00:06:29.200 and self-determination in --> 00:06:30.720 your own chosen actions. --> 00:06:32.680 The second pillar, --> 00:06:34.120 however, is competence. --> 00:06:34.960 And competence --> 00:06:35.760 is characterized --> 00:06:36.680 by the need --> 00:06:37.640 to feel effective --> 00:06:38.320 and capable --> 00:06:40.720 of your own actions. --> 00:06:41.480 The goal here --> 00:06:42.600 is to reach a sense --> 00:06:43.960 of accomplishment --> 00:06:45.560 with your own actions, --> 00:06:47.160 and there is a deep underlying --> 00:06:48.200 desire to master --> 00:06:49.080 new skills, --> 00:06:50.080 to feel competent --> 00:06:52.240 over and over again, --> 00:06:52.960 because you now --> 00:06:54.440 feel like you are capable --> 00:06:54.920 to learn --> 00:06:55.880 any skill --> 00:06:58.160 that you ever want to. --> 00:06:58.880 The third pillar, --> 00:07:00.240 however, in this theory --> 00:07:01.760 is the relatedness --> 00:07:02.680 And relatedness --> 00:07:03.880 means the feeling --> 00:07:05.440 of social connectedness, --> 00:07:06.000 a sense --> 00:07:06.760 of belonging --> 00:07:08.200 to a social group, --> 00:07:09.360 and the establishment --> 00:07:11.080 of meaningful relationships --> 00:07:12.400 to other humans. --> 00:07:12.880 That's why --> 00:07:13.520 we say --> 00:07:15.640 that humans are social beings, --> 00:07:17.080 because every human --> 00:07:19.120 has the deep internal wish --> 00:07:20.880 for social connections --> 00:07:22.360 and social interactions --> 00:07:23.560 on a daily basis. --> 00:07:25.440 But now how can we implement --> 00:07:27.080 those theoretical structures --> 00:07:27.760 of the three --> 00:07:28.840 motivational models? --> 00:07:30.160 I just brought to you --> 00:07:32.320 into our HYROX coaching. --> 00:07:33.160 First of all, --> 00:07:34.080 we need to --> 00:07:35.360 create an environment --> 00:07:36.920 that supports the athlete's --> 00:07:38.000 competence, --> 00:07:39.840 autonomy and relatedness --> 00:07:40.520 to enhance --> 00:07:42.000 their overall motivation. --> 00:07:42.680 So we need to --> 00:07:44.760 create an atmosphere --> 00:07:45.920 that supports --> 00:07:47.280 every three pillars --> 00:07:47.640 of the --> 00:07:49.480 self-determination theory. --> 00:07:50.200 Then of course, --> 00:07:51.280 we can make use --> 00:07:52.600 of extrinsic rewards --> 00:07:53.440 from time to time --> 00:07:54.760 to keep the motivation --> 00:07:56.120 up in our training group. --> 00:07:58.080 This can be literally anything --> 00:07:59.920 from the nice tasting sports --> 00:08:02.400 drink to a Velcro patch --> 00:08:03.440 for their built --> 00:08:04.760 for athletes backpacks. --> 00:08:06.560 Anything literally. --> 00:08:07.160 Thirdly, --> 00:08:08.640 we need to create --> 00:08:10.880 somewhat of a community --> 00:08:12.440 within our training group --> 00:08:13.720 or with our athletes --> 00:08:15.440 in order to again --> 00:08:17.000 support their relatedness --> 00:08:17.800 and their need --> 00:08:19.240 for social interaction --> 00:08:20.760 and social connection. --> 00:08:21.360 and of course, --> 00:08:22.440 we need to make sure --> 00:08:23.080 that our training --> 00:08:24.520 facility fulfills --> 00:08:25.760 all of the basic needs. --> 00:08:26.720 So we need to offer --> 00:08:27.640 something to drink --> 00:08:28.960 and maybe something to eat, --> 00:08:30.000 like a little snack. --> 00:08:30.560 If the body --> 00:08:31.520 circuit lowers down --> 00:08:32.520 during training, --> 00:08:33.440 we need to make sure --> 00:08:34.400 we have toilets --> 00:08:35.720 or even showers --> 00:08:37.760 and a overall facility --> 00:08:40.320 where people can feel safe. --> 00:08:40.600 So. --> 00:08:41.080 Well, guys, --> 00:08:41.520 that's it --> 00:08:42.920 for today's presentation. --> 00:08:44.440 Just a brief overview over --> 00:08:45.160 three different --> 00:08:46.640 motivational theories --> 00:08:48.320 and how you can implement them --> 00:08:50.240 into your coaching conception. --> 00:08:51.240 Now on screen --> 00:08:52.920 you have a quick summary --> 00:08:54.320 over the previous slides --> 00:08:55.200 that you can look at --> 00:08:56.280 if you'd like to. --> 00:08:56.840 Otherwise, --> 00:08:58.080 I would like you to answer --> 00:08:59.240 the review questions, --> 00:09:00.480 to reflect on the learned, --> 00:09:01.520 and to brainstorm --> 00:09:02.960 how you can implement --> 00:09:04.160 the need fulfillment --> 00:09:05.480 of the different theories --> 00:09:07.280 into your coaching conception. --> 00:09:08.120 And then I would like --> 00:09:08.640 to thank you --> 00:09:09.400 for your attention. --> 00:09:10.520 And I will see you guys --> 00:09:11.960 in the next lesson. Cheers."

Chapter: Group forming --> 00:00:00.760 Hello everyone, --> 00:00:01.320 and welcome --> 00:00:02.520 to the first of our --> 00:00:03.800 last presentations --> 00:00:05.200 inside of the Sports --> 00:00:06.480 Psychology module. --> 00:00:07.680 In this presentation today --> 00:00:08.400 we will be talking --> 00:00:10.080 about the group forming process. --> 00:00:10.760 This process --> 00:00:12.320 will be very important for you. --> 00:00:13.960 As I said in the intro, --> 00:00:15.000 if you are looking forward --> 00:00:16.080 to train your clients --> 00:00:17.160 in a group setting, --> 00:00:18.240 the schedule for today --> 00:00:19.440 is to just get a brief --> 00:00:20.440 overview of what --> 00:00:21.440 sports groups are. --> 00:00:22.800 Then jump right into the group --> 00:00:24.680 forming process itself, --> 00:00:25.920 and then after that, --> 00:00:27.040 constructing a HYROX --> 00:00:27.680 use case --> 00:00:29.040 for how we can use the knowledge --> 00:00:29.640 of this group --> 00:00:30.440 forming process --> 00:00:32.160 for our HYROX coaching. --> 00:00:33.960 So what are sports groups? --> 00:00:36.280 Sports groups are defined --> 00:00:37.640 as a conglomeration --> 00:00:39.560 of at least two or more people --> 00:00:41.920 that have a joint overall goal --> 00:00:43.160 of performing a sports --> 00:00:44.760 specific training or sports --> 00:00:46.200 specific activity, --> 00:00:47.520 because we find ourselves --> 00:00:49.960 in the overall topic of sports. --> 00:00:50.760 And sports groups, --> 00:00:51.480 as we will see --> 00:00:53.120 in the next presentation, --> 00:00:54.120 can either have --> 00:00:55.680 a positive impact --> 00:00:56.400 on performance, --> 00:00:57.680 which obviously results --> 00:00:59.080 in an increased performance. --> 00:01:00.480 But sports groups can also --> 00:01:01.760 have the negative impact, --> 00:01:03.960 which will decrease performance --> 00:01:05.160 of the overall sports --> 00:01:06.560 groups and of each member. --> 00:01:07.320 But all of this --> 00:01:08.680 we will taken into deeper --> 00:01:09.600 consideration --> 00:01:11.080 in the next presentation, --> 00:01:12.440 because this presentation --> 00:01:13.920 will be about the group --> 00:01:15.120 forming process. --> 00:01:15.480 The group --> 00:01:16.920 forming process itself --> 00:01:19.880 was stated by Tuckman in 1965 --> 00:01:22.080 and consists of five stages, --> 00:01:22.920 which are called --> 00:01:24.120 forming, storming --> 00:01:25.400 norming, performing, --> 00:01:27.440 and adjourning. --> 00:01:28.680 And we will now take a look --> 00:01:29.400 at every stage --> 00:01:30.640 in particular detail, --> 00:01:32.360 starting with the first phase. --> 00:01:33.120 The first phase --> 00:01:34.240 is called forming, --> 00:01:35.800 and it can also be seen --> 00:01:37.240 as the orientation --> 00:01:38.520 phase of a new group --> 00:01:39.360 forming process --> 00:01:40.560 because it's characterized --> 00:01:41.880 by an introduction --> 00:01:42.600 and politeness. --> 00:01:43.640 So all of the members --> 00:01:44.800 are just slightly --> 00:01:45.960 getting to know each other. --> 00:01:46.560 And of course, --> 00:01:47.560 if you want to get to know --> 00:01:48.200 new people, --> 00:01:49.760 you exhibit polite behavior --> 00:01:50.680 most of the time. --> 00:01:51.520 Then there's a huge --> 00:01:52.440 lack of clarity --> 00:01:54.360 about roles inside the groups. --> 00:01:55.440 There are no specific --> 00:01:56.120 group goals --> 00:01:58.120 yet and unclear expectations --> 00:01:59.240 within the group. --> 00:01:59.880 Second of all, --> 00:02:01.360 there's a big lack of clarity --> 00:02:03.160 about the roles of the group --> 00:02:05.160 and the roles of each members --> 00:02:06.360 inside of the group. --> 00:02:07.800 There is a lack of knowledge --> 00:02:09.160 about common goals --> 00:02:10.640 and expectations --> 00:02:11.600 within the group, --> 00:02:13.720 so there's a lot of uncertainty. --> 00:02:14.640 And because of this great --> 00:02:16.080 amount of uncertainty, --> 00:02:17.280 there is a high level --> 00:02:18.960 of dependance to the coach. --> 00:02:20.280 So the members --> 00:02:21.760 look up to the group leader --> 00:02:22.760 for guidance --> 00:02:24.120 and seek to understand --> 00:02:25.360 the purpose of the group. --> 00:02:26.400 With this dependance --> 00:02:27.000 to the coach, --> 00:02:28.080 there comes an eagerness --> 00:02:29.760 to please from all members, --> 00:02:31.440 which is a desire --> 00:02:32.400 among those members --> 00:02:33.120 to get along --> 00:02:34.840 and make positive impressions --> 00:02:35.520 on others --> 00:02:36.600 or most importantly, --> 00:02:37.400 on the coach. --> 00:02:38.240 And then lastly, --> 00:02:39.360 this stage is recognized --> 00:02:41.280 by an initial exploration, --> 00:02:43.120 which means that the members --> 00:02:43.480 start --> 00:02:45.120 to explore the boundaries --> 00:02:46.080 and test --> 00:02:47.640 what behavior is acceptable --> 00:02:48.600 and what not. --> 00:02:49.640 The second phase --> 00:02:51.000 is called storming, --> 00:02:52.560 and it's characterized --> 00:02:55.080 by a lot of conflict emerge --> 00:02:56.240 because there are differences --> 00:02:57.520 in opinions, ideas, --> 00:02:58.720 and approaches --> 00:03:00.080 in between the group members --> 00:03:00.640 because they've --> 00:03:01.880 just met each other. --> 00:03:02.520 And that's why --> 00:03:03.800 this phase is also called --> 00:03:04.800 the conflict phase. --> 00:03:06.200 And because the group members --> 00:03:07.240 have just come together --> 00:03:07.880 as a group, --> 00:03:09.040 there are power struggles --> 00:03:09.920 that become apparent --> 00:03:11.400 because some individuals --> 00:03:14.280 may influence or challenge --> 00:03:15.600 the authority --> 00:03:16.520 of the group leader, --> 00:03:18.640 which in our case is the coach. --> 00:03:19.840 Once the group members --> 00:03:21.280 are testing their boundaries --> 00:03:22.240 so they push --> 00:03:24.080 against these established norms, --> 00:03:26.040 or challenging the group leader --> 00:03:28.400 and trying to redefine --> 00:03:29.320 some of the rules, --> 00:03:30.960 the group leader tried to set. --> 00:03:32.400 There is a high amount --> 00:03:34.200 of emotional expression, --> 00:03:35.160 because some members --> 00:03:36.640 might be frustrated --> 00:03:37.800 with the way --> 00:03:39.240 the coach wants them to train, --> 00:03:41.160 or there are some concerns --> 00:03:41.640 that they might --> 00:03:43.200 shout out openly. --> 00:03:44.000 And because of this, --> 00:03:44.640 it comes --> 00:03:46.080 to the formation of cliques, --> 00:03:47.560 where subgroups may form --> 00:03:49.080 within the larger groups --> 00:03:50.640 because some of the members --> 00:03:52.280 have same views --> 00:03:53.720 or the same values --> 00:03:55.200 on different aspects. --> 00:03:56.280 The third phase, --> 00:03:56.960 on the other hand, --> 00:03:58.160 which is called norming --> 00:03:59.640 and sometimes even --> 00:04:01.600 the organizational phase, --> 00:04:02.760 is also characterized --> 00:04:04.480 by a conflict resolution. --> 00:04:06.040 So if conflicts did arise --> 00:04:07.120 in the first stage --> 00:04:08.680 of getting to know each other, --> 00:04:09.480 the group works --> 00:04:11.040 through those disagreements --> 00:04:12.120 in this stage --> 00:04:13.360 and finds compromises --> 00:04:14.200 and solutions. --> 00:04:15.560 Then an establishment --> 00:04:16.560 of norms happens, --> 00:04:18.400 so the group members --> 00:04:19.440 now have shared --> 00:04:21.040 values and expectations, --> 00:04:22.160 what they want to achieve --> 00:04:23.080 with the groups --> 00:04:24.440 and this whole set of norms --> 00:04:25.760 provides a framework --> 00:04:26.800 for cooperation --> 00:04:27.640 and collaboration --> 00:04:28.840 inside of the group. --> 00:04:30.440 In combination to this trust --> 00:04:31.400 building a role, --> 00:04:32.640 clarification happens --> 00:04:33.920 so the members --> 00:04:35.080 now understand --> 00:04:36.320 their responsibilities --> 00:04:37.560 within the group, --> 00:04:39.960 and everyone is contributing --> 00:04:41.200 to the overall group --> 00:04:41.960 that they set --> 00:04:43.560 in the beginning phase. --> 00:04:44.040 And through --> 00:04:45.080 those earlier points, --> 00:04:46.800 a supportive atmosphere arises, --> 00:04:48.880 so a sense of camaraderie --> 00:04:50.680 and solidarity emerges. --> 00:04:51.960 Coming through the third phase, --> 00:04:53.480 which is called performing --> 00:04:54.960 all of the earlier points --> 00:04:56.040 or all of the earlier --> 00:04:57.920 aspects are integrated --> 00:05:00.080 into the actual action --> 00:05:01.200 of the group itself. --> 00:05:02.400 That's why it's also called --> 00:05:03.480 integration phase. --> 00:05:04.880 In this phase is characterized --> 00:05:05.520 by the peak --> 00:05:06.480 performance of the group, --> 00:05:07.840 so the group operates --> 00:05:08.760 at its highest level --> 00:05:10.720 of efficiency and effectiveness --> 00:05:12.040 because everyone --> 00:05:14.040 is contributing something --> 00:05:15.280 towards the group goal. --> 00:05:15.800 And of course, --> 00:05:16.920 to reach the peak performance, --> 00:05:18.000 you need a lot of synergy. --> 00:05:19.160 So all of the members --> 00:05:19.840 work together --> 00:05:20.520 seamlessly, --> 00:05:21.640 leveraging each other's --> 00:05:22.840 strengths and talents --> 00:05:23.920 just because they now --> 00:05:24.720 know each other --> 00:05:26.160 and have trust in each other --> 00:05:27.640 and have bonded, --> 00:05:28.480 and they can now --> 00:05:29.640 rely on each other. --> 00:05:30.400 Because of the peak --> 00:05:30.840 performance, --> 00:05:31.840 the group is now --> 00:05:33.600 reaching their milestone goals, --> 00:05:34.400 which results --> 00:05:35.880 in a high level of trust --> 00:05:36.560 and confidence --> 00:05:38.760 in between the group members, --> 00:05:40.320 allowing for even more open --> 00:05:42.160 communication and the start --> 00:05:43.320 of new friendships. --> 00:05:44.200 In addition to that, --> 00:05:46.320 this phase is also characterized --> 00:05:48.200 by a clear focus on the tasks, --> 00:05:50.040 so the group always remains --> 00:05:52.200 focused at the task at hand, --> 00:05:52.960 and they are --> 00:05:54.880 constantly prioritizing --> 00:05:55.760 the mission --> 00:05:57.840 over their individual interests. --> 00:05:58.760 And once they reach --> 00:05:59.760 that goals, there, --> 00:06:00.240 of course, --> 00:06:00.840 is that pride --> 00:06:01.840 and accomplishment. --> 00:06:02.960 So members --> 00:06:04.640 take pride in their achievement --> 00:06:05.440 as a group --> 00:06:06.560 where each --> 00:06:08.000 and every single member --> 00:06:08.760 is praised --> 00:06:10.480 for the individual effort. --> 00:06:11.320 Last but not least, --> 00:06:12.720 there is the breaking up --> 00:06:14.520 phase, so-called adjourning, --> 00:06:15.320 which resembles --> 00:06:16.720 that the group now has reached --> 00:06:17.760 its set goals, --> 00:06:18.520 which in our case --> 00:06:19.840 could mean the participation --> 00:06:20.920 in the HYROX race, --> 00:06:21.720 and therefore --> 00:06:22.400 they have now --> 00:06:23.720 completed their task, --> 00:06:24.400 leading --> 00:06:26.640 to kind of a sense of closure --> 00:06:27.480 and a --> 00:06:29.280 pride in their accomplishments. --> 00:06:30.360 Because their objective --> 00:06:31.240 is now fulfilled. --> 00:06:33.040 There is a lot of reflection --> 00:06:34.160 and evaluation --> 00:06:35.160 taking place --> 00:06:36.400 where all of the members --> 00:06:38.040 reflect on their experience --> 00:06:38.520 as a group, --> 00:06:39.520 but also on --> 00:06:40.680 their own contributions --> 00:06:41.760 towards the group goal, --> 00:06:42.720 where they evaluate --> 00:06:44.080 what lessons they've learned --> 00:06:45.280 and and if there are --> 00:06:46.800 some areas for improvement maybe. --> 00:06:48.400 In addition to that, --> 00:06:50.320 because of the deep reflection --> 00:06:51.240 and evaluation --> 00:06:52.200 that's taking place, --> 00:06:54.120 there's a lot of recognition --> 00:06:55.320 of the contributions --> 00:06:56.240 of each member. --> 00:06:57.880 So every individual --> 00:06:59.080 is recognized --> 00:07:00.560 for its contributions --> 00:07:01.080 to the group. --> 00:07:02.960 Success, which is again --> 00:07:03.840 fostering --> 00:07:05.600 a sense of appreciation --> 00:07:07.040 within the group, --> 00:07:09.000 building a lot of more trust --> 00:07:11.120 and maybe new friendships. --> 00:07:12.120 Since the objective --> 00:07:13.440 is fulfilled, members --> 00:07:15.480 now make plans for the future, --> 00:07:16.360 which can involve --> 00:07:17.280 staying connected --> 00:07:18.080 with each other --> 00:07:19.440 or pursuing --> 00:07:20.640 new opportunities, --> 00:07:22.000 leaving the group, training --> 00:07:24.360 for the next HYROX together. --> 00:07:26.280 Basically everything can happen, --> 00:07:27.520 but there most likely --> 00:07:29.360 will be a few goodbyes --> 00:07:31.040 inside of this stage --> 00:07:31.560 and that's why --> 00:07:32.360 we, as coaches --> 00:07:34.600 need to know about these stages, --> 00:07:35.160 so we can --> 00:07:36.360 then implement the knowledge --> 00:07:38.040 into the conception --> 00:07:39.520 of our HYROX training --> 00:07:41.520 that we then support. --> 00:07:42.320 The training group --> 00:07:43.640 throughout every stage, --> 00:07:44.720 so that we make sure --> 00:07:45.800 that every stage --> 00:07:47.760 has the best possible outcome --> 00:07:49.200 that helps us --> 00:07:51.800 build a powerful and cohesive --> 00:07:52.480 sports group. --> 00:07:52.920 Therefore, --> 00:07:55.320 we definitely need to set --> 00:07:58.320 clear norms, rules and --> 00:07:59.480 guidelines --> 00:08:01.160 at the beginning of the group --> 00:08:03.520 forming process. But then --> 00:08:04.680 But then take us selves --> 00:08:05.360 back a bit --> 00:08:06.680 and not involve too much --> 00:08:08.000 Because they have to --> 00:08:09.680 solve their conflicts --> 00:08:11.040 for themselves. --> 00:08:12.000 In addition to that, --> 00:08:13.080 we can always --> 00:08:14.040 and should always --> 00:08:14.920 track and monitor --> 00:08:15.720 the progress --> 00:08:17.320 of each and every client. --> 00:08:18.560 so that we can make sure --> 00:08:19.880 each individual --> 00:08:21.440 is aware of its own --> 00:08:22.280 contributions --> 00:08:23.560 towards the group goal --> 00:08:25.040 and can appreciate --> 00:08:26.400 those contributions. --> 00:08:27.640 As well as this, --> 00:08:28.920 monitoring builds --> 00:08:30.600 case studies for us, --> 00:08:31.120 which we can --> 00:08:31.800 then use --> 00:08:33.880 to present this to new clients. --> 00:08:35.160 And then of course, last --> 00:08:35.720 but not least, --> 00:08:37.640 we always have to foster --> 00:08:38.960 a supportive atmosphere --> 00:08:40.360 throughout all of the group --> 00:08:41.680 forming process stages, --> 00:08:43.440 which will lead to an increased --> 00:08:44.840 customer satisfaction --> 00:08:45.720 and an increased --> 00:08:46.960 customer satisfaction --> 00:08:48.440 ultimately results --> 00:08:50.280 in recurring customers --> 00:08:52.360 for our HYROX facility. --> 00:08:53.080 Well guys, --> 00:08:54.040 that's it for the group --> 00:08:54.960 forming process. --> 00:08:56.600 Thank you for your attention. --> 00:08:57.800 And please continue --> 00:08:58.720 to the next lesson --> 00:09:00.160 where we will dive deeper --> 00:09:01.360 into the group effects --> 00:09:02.520 that can arise inside --> 00:09:04.160 of such a sports group. --> 00:09:06.160 And I will see you guys there. --> 00:09:06.560 Cheers. Chapter: Group effect --> 00:00:01.200 Hello everyone, --> 00:00:01.800 and welcome back --> 00:00:03.160 to this final presentation --> 00:00:04.200 of this module. --> 00:00:05.240 Today's session --> 00:00:07.120 will be about the group effects --> 00:00:08.320 in sports psychology --> 00:00:10.000 and how these group dynamics --> 00:00:11.840 can impact performance. --> 00:00:13.000 Because understanding --> 00:00:14.440 these dynamics is essential --> 00:00:15.320 for any coach --> 00:00:16.680 looking to optimize --> 00:00:17.680 team performance --> 00:00:18.920 or an individual's --> 00:00:20.280 contributions towards --> 00:00:21.240 a team goal. --> 00:00:22.480 We'll start our exploration --> 00:00:23.560 with the concept of the --> 00:00:24.160 ringelman effect, --> 00:00:25.240 as well as the concept --> 00:00:26.400 of group cohesion, --> 00:00:27.760 which are two basic --> 00:00:29.000 group dynamics --> 00:00:29.920 that occur --> 00:00:31.000 in most sports groups. --> 00:00:31.640 And then later --> 00:00:32.680 on, we will work --> 00:00:34.120 on implementing this knowledge --> 00:00:35.440 into our HYROX use case, --> 00:00:37.000 as well as giving you guys --> 00:00:37.360 a quick --> 00:00:38.440 summary of what --> 00:00:39.440 we've actually learned --> 00:00:40.520 in this module. --> 00:00:42.000 So group effects themselves --> 00:00:43.960 refer to the various ways --> 00:00:44.360 in which --> 00:00:45.240 being part --> 00:00:46.680 of a group influences --> 00:00:47.800 individual behavior --> 00:00:49.000 and performance. --> 00:00:49.760 And we will start --> 00:00:51.000 our exploration with --> 00:00:52.040 the ringelmann effect. --> 00:00:54.400 The ringelmann effect describes --> 00:00:55.480 the reduction --> 00:00:56.800 in individual effort --> 00:00:58.400 as group size increases. --> 00:00:58.720 That's --> 00:00:59.480 why it's also called --> 00:01:00.400 social loafing, --> 00:01:01.800 because it's a phenomenon --> 00:01:02.920 where individuals --> 00:01:04.200 exert less effort --> 00:01:04.720 when working --> 00:01:06.000 collectively in a group --> 00:01:07.000 compared to --> 00:01:07.600 when they would --> 00:01:09.000 work individually. --> 00:01:10.120 And this decrease --> 00:01:11.280 in individual effort --> 00:01:12.160 is oftentimes --> 00:01:14.200 attributed to a diffusion --> 00:01:16.280 of responsibility and a decrease --> 00:01:17.880 in the perceived importance --> 00:01:19.520 of one's own contributions --> 00:01:21.000 towards the group goal. --> 00:01:22.160 One of the best examples --> 00:01:23.040 to visualize during --> 00:01:23.640 the manifest --> 00:01:25.520 is the tug of war challenge, --> 00:01:26.600 because in a tug of war --> 00:01:28.120 challenge, every individual --> 00:01:29.880 needs to exert as much effort --> 00:01:31.160 as it possibly can --> 00:01:31.560 in order --> 00:01:32.840 to pull the middle of the rope --> 00:01:33.560 to their side --> 00:01:34.760 and win the challenge. --> 00:01:36.480 But some individuals --> 00:01:38.120 exert less individual effort --> 00:01:39.480 because they are relying --> 00:01:41.360 on others to pull the rope, --> 00:01:41.960 and that's --> 00:01:42.760 why it's also called --> 00:01:44.520 social loafing. --> 00:01:45.160 and this effect --> 00:01:46.640 can ultimately be broken down --> 00:01:48.160 into four main aspects, --> 00:01:49.280 which are the diffusion --> 00:01:50.480 of responsibility, --> 00:01:51.960 the social comparison, --> 00:01:53.360 the coordination losses --> 00:01:55.360 which happen in larger groups, --> 00:01:55.960 and the loss --> 00:01:57.800 of individual identity. --> 00:01:58.720 And we will take a look --> 00:01:59.920 at these four main aspects --> 00:02:01.040 right now. --> 00:02:02.680 The first aspect, the diffusion --> 00:02:03.880 of responsibility, --> 00:02:04.680 means that --> 00:02:06.120 when responsibilities --> 00:02:06.800 are shared --> 00:02:08.360 between many group members, --> 00:02:09.040 individuals --> 00:02:10.480 feel less accountable --> 00:02:11.960 for their own actions --> 00:02:13.320 towards the group goal, --> 00:02:15.040 which results in a decrease --> 00:02:16.360 in individual effort. --> 00:02:18.600 On the other hand, there --> 00:02:20.200 is the social comparison, --> 00:02:21.760 where individuals engage --> 00:02:23.040 in social comparison --> 00:02:24.080 within the group --> 00:02:25.320 and if they perceive --> 00:02:26.880 that others of the group --> 00:02:28.040 are not exerting --> 00:02:28.840 as much effort --> 00:02:29.920 as they should be, --> 00:02:31.040 they feel justified --> 00:02:32.800 to reduce their own actions --> 00:02:33.960 and their own efforts --> 00:02:34.600 towards the group --> 00:02:35.960 goal, as well. --> 00:02:37.360 Then there's the third aspect --> 00:02:38.960 of the coordination losses, --> 00:02:40.520 which means that as group size --> 00:02:41.360 increases, --> 00:02:43.160 coordination and communication --> 00:02:44.800 gets even more challenging --> 00:02:45.840 because now it becomes --> 00:02:46.920 way harder --> 00:02:47.400 to coordinate --> 00:02:48.640 what each individual --> 00:02:49.560 has to do --> 00:02:50.000 in order --> 00:02:51.240 to reach the group goal. --> 00:02:52.680 And with that, sometimes --> 00:02:54.000 inefficiencies arise, --> 00:02:55.760 which also lead to decrease --> 00:02:57.160 in individual motivation --> 00:02:59.360 as well as individual effort. --> 00:03:00.400 And last but not least, --> 00:03:01.840 there is the fourth aspect, --> 00:03:02.920 which is the loss of --> 00:03:04.240 individual identity, --> 00:03:05.280 which only happens --> 00:03:06.680 in very large groups. --> 00:03:08.680 And it means that an individual --> 00:03:10.480 may feel like its identity --> 00:03:11.760 becomes less salient --> 00:03:12.840 because the group size --> 00:03:13.960 increased so much, --> 00:03:15.560 which leads to a decrease --> 00:03:17.280 in the perceived importance --> 00:03:18.240 of an individual's --> 00:03:19.400 own contributions --> 00:03:20.920 towards the group goal, --> 00:03:21.960 and therefore they will, --> 00:03:22.480 of course, --> 00:03:24.200 not exert much effort as well. --> 00:03:25.600 So now --> 00:03:26.320 that we know what the --> 00:03:27.280 reglement effect is --> 00:03:28.720 and how it becomes obvious. --> 00:03:29.560 Let's take a quick --> 00:03:30.800 look at a few points. --> 00:03:31.400 How we as --> 00:03:33.280 coaches can reduce this effect --> 00:03:34.240 inside of our own --> 00:03:35.440 training groups. --> 00:03:36.160 So to combat --> 00:03:37.120 the ring of in effect, --> 00:03:37.920 we first of all --> 00:03:39.760 need to define clear roles --> 00:03:40.960 and expectations. --> 00:03:41.840 What we want --> 00:03:43.320 from each group member. --> 00:03:44.360 then we need to promote --> 00:03:45.760 individual accountability --> 00:03:47.120 so each group member --> 00:03:48.320 feels accountable --> 00:03:49.640 for their own contribution --> 00:03:51.040 towards the group goal. --> 00:03:51.600 Then of course, --> 00:03:52.440 as in every good --> 00:03:53.360 training session, --> 00:03:54.960 we need to constantly provide --> 00:03:56.880 feedback and recognition --> 00:03:57.360 for what --> 00:03:59.400 they have achieved so far. --> 00:04:00.000 Then of course, --> 00:04:01.080 we need to facilitate --> 00:04:03.040 communication and collaboration --> 00:04:04.360 between the group members --> 00:04:04.920 in order --> 00:04:06.480 to make sure that the group --> 00:04:08.480 is working together fluently. --> 00:04:09.320 To support this, --> 00:04:10.320 we need to set clear --> 00:04:10.880 group goals --> 00:04:12.040 so every individual --> 00:04:13.520 follows the same goal. --> 00:04:14.120 And of course --> 00:04:14.960 we need to monitor --> 00:04:15.680 the progress. --> 00:04:17.480 So every individual can see --> 00:04:18.240 what progress --> 00:04:19.520 they've made over the course --> 00:04:20.760 of the training sessions. --> 00:04:22.200 And they feel accountable --> 00:04:23.240 for what they've achieved --> 00:04:24.360 so far. --> 00:04:25.240 In addition to that --> 00:04:26.440 of course we need to promote --> 00:04:27.840 a positive group environment. --> 00:04:29.240 So every group member feels --> 00:04:31.040 welcome in our training group. --> 00:04:32.360 And as we do this, --> 00:04:33.600 we need to make sure --> 00:04:34.880 that we limit group size --> 00:04:36.480 to, let's say about --> 00:04:39.200 not more than 30 to 35 people. --> 00:04:40.320 So we make sure there --> 00:04:41.600 are no communication --> 00:04:42.480 or collaboration --> 00:04:43.960 issues arising. --> 00:04:45.120 And this brings us to --> 00:04:46.520 our second relational dynamic, --> 00:04:48.000 which is the group cohesion. --> 00:04:48.520 And group --> 00:04:49.920 cohesion describes --> 00:04:51.280 the degree of unity --> 00:04:52.560 among team members --> 00:04:54.120 and also their solidarity --> 00:04:55.160 towards each other --> 00:04:56.520 and their commitment towards --> 00:04:57.440 being an active --> 00:04:59.200 part of the group. --> 00:04:59.640 For us --> 00:05:01.280 as coaches, it's very important --> 00:05:01.960 to foster --> 00:05:03.520 these strong group bonds --> 00:05:04.440 because it --> 00:05:05.360 not only leads --> 00:05:06.840 to a better performance, --> 00:05:08.720 but to an also overall --> 00:05:10.560 higher customer satisfaction, --> 00:05:12.080 which ultimately results --> 00:05:13.920 in a happy customers for us, --> 00:05:14.600 which will then --> 00:05:16.440 become reoccurring customers --> 00:05:18.400 over the course of time. --> 00:05:19.200 So in order to --> 00:05:20.080 create these strong --> 00:05:20.880 group bonds, --> 00:05:21.880 we need to take a look --> 00:05:22.960 at the four pillars --> 00:05:24.240 of group cohesion, --> 00:05:25.720 which have been stated --> 00:05:28.160 by Albert Carron in 1980. --> 00:05:29.280 And these four pillars --> 00:05:30.800 are the task cohesion, --> 00:05:32.120 the social cohesion, --> 00:05:33.400 the group integration --> 00:05:35.160 and the individual attraction --> 00:05:36.160 towards the group. --> 00:05:37.440 And we will be taking a look --> 00:05:38.400 at these four pillars --> 00:05:39.840 on the next slide. --> 00:05:41.200 So the first pillar, --> 00:05:42.520 the task cohesion, --> 00:05:43.960 refers to the degree --> 00:05:45.000 to which group members --> 00:05:45.760 work together, --> 00:05:46.720 collectively --> 00:05:47.800 and actively --> 00:05:48.720 try to achieve --> 00:05:50.200 the goals and objectives --> 00:05:51.160 that are related --> 00:05:53.480 to the task of the group. --> 00:05:55.360 So it basically describes --> 00:05:57.040 how much group members --> 00:05:57.760 work together --> 00:05:59.320 collectively in order to --> 00:06:01.400 achieve the same task. --> 00:06:02.640 The second pillar, on the other --> 00:06:04.440 hand, is the social cohesion, --> 00:06:05.240 and it relates --> 00:06:05.760 to the --> 00:06:07.560 interpersonal relationships --> 00:06:09.520 and the social integrations --> 00:06:10.840 among the group members. --> 00:06:11.640 So how well --> 00:06:12.720 are they getting along --> 00:06:13.760 with each other? --> 00:06:14.680 And it reflects --> 00:06:16.440 a degree of mutual trust --> 00:06:18.000 in friendship and support --> 00:06:18.920 within the group, --> 00:06:20.520 as well as kind of a sense --> 00:06:22.280 of belonging to the group. --> 00:06:23.400 And this is very important --> 00:06:24.320 because it builds --> 00:06:24.960 strong --> 00:06:26.640 interpersonal relationships. --> 00:06:27.960 So the members of the group --> 00:06:29.360 are actively --> 00:06:30.640 being part of the group --> 00:06:31.520 and wanting --> 00:06:32.520 to be part of the group --> 00:06:33.960 because they feel happy --> 00:06:35.480 as being a part --> 00:06:37.040 of this training group. --> 00:06:37.880 The third pillar, on --> 00:06:38.760 the other hand, is --> 00:06:40.120 the group integration. --> 00:06:41.200 It's kind of similar --> 00:06:42.600 to the social cohesion, --> 00:06:43.440 but it's slightly --> 00:06:44.160 different nonetheless --> 00:06:45.560 because it's not that much --> 00:06:47.480 on interpersonal relationships --> 00:06:48.680 rather than --> 00:06:50.640 a common sense of unity --> 00:06:52.080 within the group. --> 00:06:53.520 And it involves the extent --> 00:06:54.680 to which members --> 00:06:56.160 identify with the group --> 00:06:57.680 and share common values, --> 00:06:59.000 and perceive themselves --> 00:07:00.080 as being part of it, --> 00:07:01.640 and want to be part of it --> 00:07:03.160 consistently. --> 00:07:04.240 And last but not least, --> 00:07:05.800 there is the fourth pillar, --> 00:07:07.240 which is the individual's --> 00:07:08.640 attraction to the group. --> 00:07:10.000 And it refers to --> 00:07:10.960 the individual's --> 00:07:12.160 personal attachment --> 00:07:13.720 and commitment to the group, --> 00:07:14.960 and it reflects --> 00:07:16.640 the individual's motivation --> 00:07:17.800 to constantly --> 00:07:19.480 remain a member of the group --> 00:07:21.200 and participate actively --> 00:07:22.040 so that the group --> 00:07:24.040 can reach its overall goals. --> 00:07:25.120 And ultimately, --> 00:07:26.600 this is very important for you --> 00:07:27.960 because you want to achieve --> 00:07:29.320 exactly this state --> 00:07:31.080 where every individual feels --> 00:07:32.080 so welcome --> 00:07:33.840 to be part of the group --> 00:07:34.840 that they are even --> 00:07:35.840 wanting others --> 00:07:36.880 to be part of the group, --> 00:07:38.080 which ultimately leads --> 00:07:39.200 to new customers --> 00:07:40.400 for your training group. --> 00:07:42.440 So now that we know --> 00:07:43.720 what group cohesion is. --> 00:07:44.880 Let's take a quick --> 00:07:46.320 look on how we as --> 00:07:47.680 coaches can increase --> 00:07:49.480 or group cohesion. --> 00:07:50.680 So we as coaches, --> 00:07:51.400 first of all, --> 00:07:52.280 we need to establish --> 00:07:53.880 clear goals and objectives --> 00:07:55.280 so that each individual --> 00:07:55.880 of our group --> 00:07:58.160 can pursue the same goals. --> 00:07:59.440 Then we need to encourage --> 00:08:00.840 open communication --> 00:08:02.320 between the group members, --> 00:08:04.240 which we do by promoting team --> 00:08:05.360 bonding activities --> 00:08:06.800 which are not necessarily --> 00:08:08.480 connected to the main activity --> 00:08:09.680 of the group itself. --> 00:08:10.800 So it can be rather --> 00:08:11.720 simple things --> 00:08:13.000 like grabbing a drink --> 00:08:14.920 or some food together. --> 00:08:15.520 Then, of course, --> 00:08:16.640 we have to provide --> 00:08:18.000 support and encouragement --> 00:08:19.200 so that if we see --> 00:08:20.440 that a group member --> 00:08:21.960 is losing its attachment --> 00:08:22.520 to the group, --> 00:08:23.680 we encourage them --> 00:08:25.640 to remain part of the group --> 00:08:26.920 and let them know --> 00:08:28.160 that the group provides --> 00:08:29.480 support for its --> 00:08:30.960 personal problems, as well. --> 00:08:34.040 And last but not --> 00:08:35.400 least, of course as coaches --> 00:08:36.360 we need to foster --> 00:08:37.840 a positive team culture. --> 00:08:39.080 So make sure that there's --> 00:08:40.840 always a positive atmosphere --> 00:08:41.720 so that people want --> 00:08:43.640 to come back to train with you, --> 00:08:44.440 and then you have --> 00:08:45.840 to lead by example. --> 00:08:47.640 So you have to show --> 00:08:48.920 the exact behavior --> 00:08:50.000 towards the group --> 00:08:51.800 that you would like to receive --> 00:08:53.000 from the group members, --> 00:08:54.920 or that you want to see between --> 00:08:55.520 the group members. --> 00:08:56.080 So leading by --> 00:08:56.640 example --> 00:08:57.960 is one of the key points --> 00:08:58.640 in reaching --> 00:08:59.880 a great group cohesion --> 00:09:01.160 inside of your HYROX --> 00:09:01.880 Training group. --> 00:09:02.400 But now --> 00:09:03.560 how can we implement --> 00:09:04.760 our theoretic knowledge --> 00:09:06.280 of these relational dynamics --> 00:09:07.400 in sports groups --> 00:09:08.320 into our HYROX --> 00:09:09.320 coaching use case. --> 00:09:09.920 First of all --> 00:09:11.120 we need to decrease --> 00:09:11.920 social loafing. --> 00:09:13.400 So we have to make sure --> 00:09:14.920 that especially clients --> 00:09:15.680 that are aiming --> 00:09:16.600 to do a doubles --> 00:09:17.600 or relay --> 00:09:18.840 are exerting --> 00:09:20.120 the same amount of effort --> 00:09:21.440 and not relying --> 00:09:22.520 on the other members --> 00:09:24.200 of the team. --> 00:09:24.800 Then, of course, --> 00:09:25.720 we need to --> 00:09:27.080 increase our group cohesion --> 00:09:28.680 alongside these four pillars. --> 00:09:29.920 As I just told you, --> 00:09:31.280 to increase --> 00:09:32.800 your customer experience, --> 00:09:33.920 which will then lead --> 00:09:35.600 to reoccurring customers --> 00:09:37.480 for your coaching business. --> 00:09:38.440 And last but not least, --> 00:09:39.640 you need to foster --> 00:09:41.520 an open feedback culture --> 00:09:42.160 so that --> 00:09:44.000 all clients feel relevant --> 00:09:45.360 in their own actions. --> 00:09:46.240 Strengthening --> 00:09:48.120 the group cohesion once again. --> 00:09:49.640 And well guys that's the end --> 00:09:51.200 for this final presentation --> 00:09:52.400 inside of our --> 00:09:53.480 of coaching module. --> 00:09:54.720 You now have completed --> 00:09:56.080 all of your presentations --> 00:09:57.720 and will head over to the Test --> 00:09:58.760 Your Learning section, --> 00:09:59.720 where you will answer --> 00:10:00.560 a few questions --> 00:10:02.040 to see if you understood --> 00:10:02.880 and actually learned --> 00:10:03.760 what has been said --> 00:10:04.800 in these presentations --> 00:10:06.360 and in the text before. --> 00:10:07.440 And then there's nothing --> 00:10:08.600 left to do for me, rather --> 00:10:09.600 than to thank you --> 00:10:10.520 for your attention, --> 00:10:11.720 wish you all the best --> 00:10:12.600 and I hope to --> 00:10:14.160 see you guys soon. Cheers"
